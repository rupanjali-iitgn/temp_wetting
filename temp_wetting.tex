\label{ID_1490725096}\subsection{The interaction between a solid surface and a liquid plays an important role in several natural and synthetic processes. An important phenomena in such systems is the wetting of a solid surface by liquid. The technological advances have enabled the development and application of solid-liquid interfaces  of increasingly microscopic dimensions. Further, there is a great scope for fine-tuning the chemical nature of solid surface at the molecular scale to achieve desired wetting behavior. Theoretical studies and computer simulations can help guide such manipulation. In this particular project we focus on the temperature dependence of the solid-liquid interfacial properties. Specifically, we will employ statistical mechanics to design solid surfaces that show desired thermal response of wetting. This will be achieved with the help of advanced molecular simulation techniques.}

\label{ID_1521482540}\subsection{Broadly speaking, the temperature dependence of solid-liquid interfacial properties are important where the solid-liquid interface plays an important role. In microfluidics and nanofluidics wetting behavior is very important and there are numerous scenarios where such devices encounter environments with varying temperatures. For example, microfluidic devices used in processes involving endothermic or exothermic reactions. Another important application is the role of temperature in the wetting of ink droplets on solid surfaces. With the application of inkjet printing technology in areas like microelectronics and solarcells it becomes important to understand how the wetting behavior of ink droplets epends on temperature. The knowledge about dynamics of heat and mass transfer is indeed crucial in the development of such realistic systems. However, it is useful to first study such systems under equilibrium conditions to understand the factors that must be considered for designing them. Moreover, such a study can provide useul insights into the underlying molecular-scale phenomena. We explain this point with the example of thermal engines based on the wetting behavior of solids [AIChE, 49, 764 (2003)]. These engines are based on a thermodynamic cycle made of processes that involve the spreading of liquid on a solid surface and have applications in micro-mechanical actuators [Energy and Environmental Science, 4, 3632] and car dampers [J. of Automobile Engg., 221, pp. 301]. If one assumes that all the involved processes are reversible then it is straightforward to relate the technologically relevant quantities of the engine to molecular-level details of the system. For example, the exchange of work and heat with the surroundings is related to the interfacial free energies (solid-liquid, liquid-vapor and solid-vapor) and their derivatives with respect to temperature, respectively. Using the framework of statistical mechanics these quantities can be further related to the chemical nature of solid surface and liquid. Thus, by designing solid surfaces that result in the desired thermal response of the wetting behavior one can, in principle, develop wetting engines having desired efficiency.}

\label{ID_412834846}\subsection{With regards to the nature of solid surface, there are several factors that can potentially affect solid-fluid interfacial free energiesand their temperature derivatives. In this project we are partiularly interested in the effect of heterogenity along the plane of the solid surface. Such a heterogenity can be due to the variation of the chemical nature or due to the surface roughness. Moreover,  it can range over multiple scales. For example, roughness can be considered at the atomistic level due to a particular arrangement of surface atoms, whereas at larger scales it can be due to variation in the macroscopic topography of the surface. Such heterogeneity affects the solid-fluid interfacial properties by influencing the correlations between local densities of the fluid molecules along the plane parallel to the surface. Therefore, in order to rationally design such a heterogeneous surface it is important to understand the contribution of abovementioned correlations to solid-fluid interfacial free energies and their derivatives with respect to temperature. In this document we refer the density-density correlations in liquid along liquid-vapor or solid-liquid interfaces as transevrse correlations (abbreviated as TC)}

Here, one important objective will be to study the possibility of designing surfaces to control contact angles and their temperature derivatives almost independent of one another.}

\label{ID_1110611260}\section{Background}

\label{ID_1392626561}\subsection{Research status (international)}

\label{ID_688891944}\subsubsection{Theoretical}

\label{ID_1917907773}\paragraph{The temperature dependence of wetting phenomenon has been closely connected with the study of wetting  from the perspective of phase coexistence. Basically, one can consider the two scenarios: 1) a solid-vapor interface being partially wet by the liquid and 2) solid-vapor interface being completely wet by the liquid as two surface "phases". Similar to coexistence between say liquid and vapor these two surface phases can be in coexistence at certain system parametrers. The parameters of interest are temperature or those related to the nature of the solid surface like the strength of interaction between solid and liquid, surface roughness etc. Analogous to wetting transitions, one may consider drying transitions where the role of liquid and vapor in the above tweo scfenarios are interchanged. [The adjacent figure 1 denotes the wetting and drying transitions]}

\label{ID_1762818689}\paragraph{In1977 Cahn proposed that there exists a temperature below the critical temperature of fluid at which the wetting transition on a given solid surface occurs. The argument was based on the comparison between the temperature dependence of \gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl}  and that of \gamma_{lv}. Cahn used a theoretical approach called as square-gradient version of Van der Waals theory and did not consider the atrraction between solid and liquid in explicit detail.}

\label{ID_1622008046}\paragraph{Later, the square-gradient theory was modified by Nakanishi and Fisher to include the dependence of solid-fluid attraction. Specifically, Nakanishi and Fisher proposed a phase diagram which represented the coexistence lines for the wetting and drying transitions in the plot of temperature vs a parameter denoting the strength of solid-fluid interaction. Their phase diagram shows that for weak solid-liquid interaction, increase in temperature brings the system closer to drying transition. Whereas for strong solid-fluid interactions, increase in temperature brings the system closer to the wetting transition. It should be noted, however, that  these theories do not consider the molecualr-level details of the solid surface or liquid. Therefore, the observations do not provide quantitative predictions of the wetting behavior in real systems.. Secondly, the above studies only understand the behavior of systems "at" the wetting and drying transitions. From a technological perspective, it is also important to understand the temperature dependence of contact angles in the partial wetting regime.}

\label{ID_1378614173}\paragraph{Another theoretical approach that is applied to understand the wetting behavior is claasical Density Functional theory (DFT). This theory considers molecular-level details of the system but is computationally less expensive as compared to molecular simulations. It considers the system in grand canonical ensemble and expresses the grand potential as a functional of the space-dependent density of the fluid. The equilibrium density of the fluid is calculated by minimizing the grand potential. The interfacial free energies like \gamma_{sv} \gamma_{sl} and \gamma_{lv} are then obtained from the equilibrium density profile via the graand potential. Though this approach can be only used for very simple systems, it is able to provide qualitative understanding of the observations in real systems}

\label{ID_53484468}\paragraph{One of the first applications of DFT to study wetting behavior is by Sullivan (J. Chem Phys, 74, 2601) who employed the Van der Vaals theory without the square-gradient approximation. Particularly, the Cahn's definition of solid surface was reinterpreted in terms of a more realistic solid-fluid interaction potential. This enabled Sullivan to study the variation of contact angle theta over a range of solid-fluid interaction strengths (\epsilo_w ). at multiple temperatures. It was observed that for small \epsilon_{w} - where theta is large - \theta increased with temperature. On the other hand, for large \epsilon_{w} \theta decreased with temperature. Similar influence of solid-fluid interactions on the temperature dependence of \theta was also observed in more recent DFT studies. Kuiper and Blokhuis (J. Chem. Phys, 131, 044702 (2009)) used DFT to reinterpret the square-gradient model of Nakanishi and Fisher described earlier in terms of the realistic solid-fluid interactions. In addition to verifying the phase diagram of wetting and drying transitions as observed by Nakanishi and Fisher, they computed the contact angles for a wide range of substrate-fluid interaction strengths \epsilon_{w}. Here, \epsilon_{w} was characterized by the depth of square-well potential between solid and fluid. As in study of Sullivan, contact angles increased with temperature for small \epsilon_{w} whereas, opposite trnd was observed for large \epsilo_{w}. Recently, Berim and Ruckenstein employed the canonical version of DFT to study the temperature dependence of contact angles over a range of substrate-fluid interaction strengths. The system they studied was a liquid drop on a solid surface instead of a liquid film in contact with surface as studied by earlier mentioned works. The contact angle was also measured visually at the three phase contact line. Their solid surface was more realistic than the earlier studies and consisted of discrete molecules interacting with fluid molecules via Lennard Jones potential. The LJ parameter for the solid-fluid interaction \epsilon_{sf} characterized the substrate-fluid interaction strength. Like earlier studies, they observed that \theta increased with temperature for low \epsilon_{sf} whereas opposite trends were observed for larg \epsilo_{sf}. The notable distinction from the earlier studies was that the transition from the former regime to the later regime happened over a very narrow range of \epsilo_{sf}. Berim and Ruckenstein commented on the significance of the intermediate substrate-strength \epsilon_{sf}^o at which the \theta is almost independent of temperature. The above studies indicate that the temperature dependence of \theta show some general trends with respect to the strength of attraction between surface and fluid, irrespective of the actual form of interaction potential. That being said, the complexity of systems that can be handled using DFT is limited. Especially, the heterogeneity of the solid surface that may play an important role in the wetting behavior was not considered.}

\label{ID_678529580}\paragraph{We finally note that the observed phase diagrams of wetting-drying transitions and the influence of solid-fluid attraction strength are related. The latter behavior may be roughly predicted from the phase coexistence curves in the T vs \epsilon_{w} plane as shown in [Figure 2]. One may observe that as T increases, the range of \epsilon_{w} corresponding to the partial wetting regime narrows down and therefore the plots of cos\theta vs \epsilon_{w}become steaper as recently commented by Henderson [Discussion notes on European Physical Journal, 197, 163 (2011)]. However, it is not trivial to explain the vaery narrow range of \epsilon_{w} over which the inversion in T-dependence occurs. Another important point is that, apart from the strength of the surface-fluid interaction, very few theoretical studies have attempted to understand the temperature dependence in terms of the role played by the molecular scale phenomena. Most of the arguments invoke the macroscopic physics of the system, say related to the surface phase coexistence. Though it is just a matter of interpretation, explaining the observations in terms of molecular scle phenomena can aid in the technological application of various observations.}

\label{ID_869146050}\subsubsection{Experimental}

\label{ID_220869422}\paragraph{Wetting of liquids on solid surfaces is a vast field with numerous applications. In recent years, numerous experimental studies have documented wetting properties on natural and artificial surfaces. This trend is fuelled by the improved ability to manipulate microscopic and nanoscopic details of the surfaces and the measurement devices. One of the most important sub-field of the wetting research is the investigation of solid surfaces that have superhydrophobic properties. In most studies, the equilibrium property that is measured is the contact angle that a small liquid drop makes with the solid surface. In others, instead of liquid drop the force of adhesion between liquid and a solid surface is measured, or the time required for absorption of a liquid in a column packed with the desired solid material is determined. The later two methods then use theoretical models to relate the measured quantities to the contact angle. Most of these studies use contact angle to characterize the hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of the solid surfaces. Generally, the main goal of such studies is to design a solid surface by manipulating a single feature of solid surface, either roughness  [Nanoscale, 8, 4635 (2016)] or soldi-fluid interaction [J. Phys. Chem. B (1999), 103, 2188-2194]. Relatively fewer studies have been performed to understand the wetting behavior where combinations of two or more surface features are considered [Chem. Rev., 2014, 114 (19), pp 10044–10094] Coming to the temperature dependence, the available experimental data is even rare. The most prominent set of data is by Neumann and colleagues [Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 4, 105 (1974)],[Advances in Colloid and Interface Science (1974), 4, (2-3), 105-91] and [Journal of Apllied Polymer Science, 42, 1959 (1991)], who studied the temperature dependence of contact angles on different polymer surfaces. It was observed that the contact angles may increase or decrease with the nature of the solid surface, especially the strength of interaction between solid and fluid. These results approximately complied with the expectations from the theories. However, it should be noted that the systems used in these experiments are more complex than those generally used in theoretical investigations. The complex nature of the solid surface meant that many factors related to the surface may have contributed to the observed temperature dependence. For example, in addition to changes on the liquid side of the solid-liquid interface, polymer surfaces may have been significantly influenced by change in temperature.  Recently, there have been studies concerned with the development of solid surfaces which can switch from hydrophilic to hydrophobic behavior with increase in temperature [1) Langmuir, 2003, 19 (7), pp 2545–2549 2) ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2014, 6 (24), pp 22666–22672  3) Polymer (2014), 55(25), 6552-6560]. These surfaces are made by grafting certain polymers on a solid base. The grafted polymers undergo transition from the extended state to the collapsed state on increasing temperature, which changes their interaction with the liquid molecules, therby resulting in the change of wetting behavior. Thus, the observed thermal response of wetting is actually the manifestation of the phase behavior of polymers in a particular liquid. In the proposed project we plan to first decopule the thermally induced changes occuring in the solid surface from those in the liquid. We will only study solid surfaces whose structure is negligibly influenced by the changes in temperature or by the liquid. Therefore, we don consider systems like solid surfaces grafted with thermal responsive polymers. Such systems will be considered in our In a future study where we plan to gradually make the solid surfaces flexible so that they respond to the changes in temperature.}

\label{ID_566286120}\paragraph{Apart from measurement of contact angles, the wetting behavior on solid surfaces have also been studied by looking at the growth of a thin liquid film on the surface of interest under controlled conditions. This approach is more in line with the theoretical studies concerned with wetting and drying transistions. Typically, the eqilibrium thickness of a liquid film on a surface indicates whether the system is in complete drying (\theta = \pi), partial wetting or complete wetting (\theta = 0) regime. The transitions between each of these regimes can be considered as surface phase transitions akin to those between bulk phases, say liquid and vapor. It is then possible to represent these regimes in a surface phase diagrams in the plane of temperature vs some order parameter characterizing the surface feature of interest. This order parameter may be related to attraction between surface and fluid molecules \epsilon_{w} or roughness   Several such studies have been performed with goal of studying the fundamental aspects of wetting transitions [Rep. Prog. Phys. 64 (2001) 1085–1163]. Most of these studies consider the temperature temperature dependence because it is the system variable that is used to study the transition. However, due to the technical challenges involved in performing such studies, the solid surfaces they investigate are relatively less complex than those employed in the experiments measuring contact angles. As a result, to our knowledge, no systematic data is available as a function of either \epsilon_{w} or roughness. Unlike wetting transitions, drying transitions have not been studied using experiments. Such studies can be useful in understanding the thermal response of wetting on solid surfaces where contact angles are large. That being siad, in the proposed project we do not plan to experimentally study the wetting and drying transitions using the above approach. This is because at this stage, there are several technical challenges in employing these methods to study the solid-fluid systems that we wish to consider. Moreover, it is impractical to employ such techniques to study wetting on many different types of solid surfaces. Finally, we note that unlike solid surfaces, the technical challenges in using the "growth of liquid film approach"  to study wetting on liquid-vapor or liquid-liquid interfaces are less severe. However, such systems are outside the scope of the current project.}

\label{ID_1521593594}\subsubsection{Computational}

\label{ID_836925790}\paragraph{Here we focus our discussion on the Molecular Dynamics (MD) or Monte Carlo (MC) simulation studies performed to study equilibrium wetting behavior of liquids on solid surfaces. The number of such studies have grown in previous few years to predict the wetting behavior on novel surfaces that can be manipulated at increasingly smaller scales. The trend has also been fuelled by the discovery of new applications for the novel substances like room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) and graphene. The molecular simulations provide two main advantages: 1) They can be used to estimate the wetting behavior in systems that are yet to developed and therefore, guide the rational design of soldi surfaces. This is important because as the scale of features on a surface decreases, the conventional theories that are mostly based on continuum approximation fail because of discreet nature of molecules.  2) They can be used to understand the molecular-level aspects of the wetting behavior that is observed in experiments. The important challenges in any molecular simulation studye are as follows: 1) Upper limit on the system size due to steep increase in the required computational resources. Therefore, as will be done in the proposed study, they are only limited to the systems with sizes less than few nanometers. 2) The results depend on the models of molecules. Ideally, it is expected that the models are parameterized to reproduce the experimental properties. However, if prediction of properties is the objective, such parameterization is not possible. In the current study we do not focus on the the quantitative prediction of properties for real systems. Also, we do not aim to rigorously understand the molecular level phenomena of real systems that are used in experiments. Our objective is to gather the general trends in the macroscopic properties by varying certain features of the solid surface. This allows us to use simple models for molecules of liquids and solids and work at conditions that enable effeicient calculation of desired properties.}

\label{ID_1292693061}\paragraph{There are two important ways of computing the wetting properties like interfacial free energies and contact angles from molecular simulations. One approach is by actually simulating a nanodroplet of a liquid on a solid surface. This strategy is generally employed via MD simulations. This is analogous to the sessile drop method in experiments.  The contact angle is then determined from the angle that the liquid-vapor interface makes with the solid surface at the three phase contact line. One important difference from the xperiments is that the interfaces can be more precisely defined based on the local fluid densities. The solid-liquid \gamma_{sl}  and solid-vapor \gamma_{sv} interfacial free energies are then calculated using the Young's equation. The main limitations of this approach are: 1) Large systems need to be considered to account for the effect of line tensions [Physica A 196 (1993) 335-348 ] on the observed values of the contact angle and 2) Discrepancies may be observed at high temperatures if the droplet is not in equilibrium with surrounding vapor. This method was recently employed to determine the contact angles of a monoatomic liquid on solid surfaces at different temperatures. [Langmuir, 2014, 30 (45), pp 13606–13614] [Langmuir, 2010, 26 (13), pp 10913–10917]. In these studies, the authors studied surfaces having different parameters for the solid-fluid interaction strengths \epsilon_{sw}. The selected surfaces enabled them to look at the temperature dependence of all three wetting regimes: complete drying, partial wetting and complete wetting. They observed that the contact angles \theta  increase with temperature for small \epsilon_{sw} and decrease with temperature for large \epsilon_{sw}. Importantly, they observed that the inversion of temperature dependence happens sharply at \epsilon_{sw}^o where \theta = 90^o and the variation of cos\theta with \epsilon_sw is symmetric about \epsilon_{sw}^o. This observation was explained by referiing to the linear dependence of solid-fluid interfacial free energies on fluid densities and \epsilon_{sw}. The opposite trends with temperature for weak and strong surfaces are expected from theory, as both wetting and drying transitions are favored at high temperatures. However, from a statistical-mechanical perspective, one neither expects the inversion to occur at a single value of \epsilon_{sw} nor that it should correspond to the \theta = 90^o.}

\label{ID_1217236864}\paragraph{The second way of applying molecular simulations is by using an open system where the number of fluid molecules is variable. Such a simulated system is compliant with the statistical-mechanics-based theories on wetting because at microscopic scales, the interface exchanges fluid molecules with the surroundings. Simulation prformed for such a system (or in grand canonical ensemble), also makes it easier to maintain the liquid-vapor saturation conditions that are necessary to study equlibrium wetting phenomenon. Here, instead of simulating a nanodroplet, one tracks the variation of free energy as a liquid film is grown on a solid surface after starting from the saturated vapor phase [J. Chem. Phys. 128, 014710 (2008)]. The properties like \gamma_{lv} and \gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl} can then be computed from such a profile. Contact angles are then computed by using the Young's equation. Such studies are generally performed by using MC simulations. The application of such a free-energy-based strategy also enables one to use "Alchemical" techniques where the nature of the solid surface can be gradually changed to study  the effect of a particular surface feature on the wetting behavior.[J. Chem. Phys. 135, 184702 (2011)] . These methods have been previously employed to study the wetting behavior in different solid-fluid systems at different temperatures. [J. Chem. Phys. 135, 234102 (2011)] , [J. Chem. Phys. 135, 184702 (2011)], [J. Chem. Phys. 141, 174706 (2014)]. Similar to the studies mentioned in the previous section, the calculations were performed over a wide range of solid-fluid interaction strengths \epsilon_{sw}. Here too it was observed that for small \epsilo_{sw} contact angles increase with temperature whereas opposite trnd exists for large \epsilon_{sw}. However, unlike the studies on nanodroplet, the inversion of temperature dependence was not sharp, but occurred over a narrow range of \epsilon_{sw}. Also, this range depended on the chemical nature of the fluid as well as the solid surface and in most cases, corresponded to \theta diiferent from 90^o. These obervations are in agreement with the theoretical predictions based on the density functional theory [J. Chem Phys, 74, 2601].}

\label{ID_862548497}\paragraph{The above discussion shows that inspite of the discrepancies in the observations of the two types of molecular simulation studies, they indicate that there is good potential for manipulating the thermal response of the wetting behavior by modifying the nature of solid surface. Along these lines, it is important to understand the role of different molecular-scale phenomena on the temperature dependence of wetting properties and simulations can play an important role in this endeavor.}

\label{ID_1942058277}\subsubsection{Role of TCs}

\label{ID_896680657}\paragraph{The role of TCs in the temperature dependence of the wetting behavior can be understood in two ways. First, by looking at the contribution of CWs to the interfacial free energies at liquid-vapor-like interfaces. CWs are the undulations of the liquid-vapor interface in the direction perpendicular to the macroscopic interface which result in long-ranged TCs along the l-v interface. Let us say that our system is 3D with l-v interface in x-y plane, then the l-v interface for a particular confguration of molecules can be defined as z = \xi (x,y). Let z = 0 then represent the averaged l-v interface . The undulations of this surface is then analyzed by performing the spectral analysis of \xi as follows: Here, r is the vector  in the x-y plane. As k increases, the corresponding terms denote the contributions from the undulations of short wavelength. The capillary wave theory, defines the CWs as the undulations of very large wavelength, that is k \rightarrow 0. The macroscopic surface tension  \sigma can be expressed as the sum of the "bulk " surface tension  \sigma_b and the one coming from the CWs \sigma_c. [Refer Phys. Rev. A, 33, 1948 (1986)] It is expected that \sigma_c &lt; 0 because undulations are entropically favorable and they decrease the interfacial free energy.  It is also possible to express a \lambda-dependent surface tension \sigma_{\lambda} which excludes the contributions from undulations above a particular wavelenght \lambda}

\label{ID_49666523}\paragraph{Kayser theoretically analyzed \sigma_{\lambda} for temperatures near triple point of liquids and those near critical point. He observed that near the triple point, when \lambda is about 10 times the molecular diameter, \sigma_{\lambda} is about 15% higher than the macroscopic value. For temperatures near Tc, the similar increase of 15% is obtained if \lambda is 20 times the molecular diameter. The contributions from undulations of larger wavelength were also found to be important in different experimental studies [ Nature, 403, 871 (2000) ]. Here, \sigma_{\lambda} was computed from the scattering intensity obtained from a carefully performed X-ray diffraction study of the l-v interface. A more thorough analysis of the temperature dependence of \sigma_{\lambda} was recently performed by Hoefling and Dietrich using molecular simulations. [EPL, 109, 46002]. They observed that the ratio \sigma_{\lambda}/\sigma is significantly altered with temperature. There observations have also been supported by the theoretical study performed by Parry, Rascon and Evans.}

\label{ID_6364435}\paragraph{ Excluding wavelengths greater than \lambda is same as restricting or pinning the l-v interface at distances separated by \lambda along xy plane. (See Adjacent figure). The conclusions from the above studies then imply that surface tension of such a pinned interface shows a different temperature dependence than that of the unpinned or free interface. In real systems, such a pinned interface can be realized in several scenarios like liquid-vapor interface confined inside a nanopore or the interface pinned between the colloidal particles. With regards to wetting, such a scenario also exists on certain solid surfaces. For example, several designs of superhydrophobic or superoleophobic surfaces have protruding stuctures having dimensions between micrometers and nanometers. When liquid sits at the top of these pillars (Cassie regime) a pinned liquid-vapor interface exists between the pillars (See the adjacent figure). Note that the macroscopic solid-liquid interface now consists of the combination of several such pinned liquid-vapor interfaces. The theoretical predictions about the temperature dependence of \sigma_{\lambda} can therefore guide one to tune the distance between these pillars and their arrangement in two dimensions to obtain the desired thermal response of the wetting behavior.}

\label{ID_1590536878}\paragraph{For more general solid surfaces which do not have such structures, the above analysis cannot be used because there are no liquid-vapor-like interfaces near the solid surface. Also for the solid surfaces with pillars, it is only valid when the distance between the pillars is much larger than the molecular diameter of the liquid. Additionaly note that the analysis will be very complicated for the solid surfaces with flexible structures. If the attraction between molecules of solid surface and those of liquid is weak then long-ranged TCs do exist near solid surface. This was recently shown for water molecules near hydrophobic surfaces using molecular simulations [PRL, 115, 016103 (2015)]. In this work Wilding and Evans used quantity called local compressibility \chi as a function of the distance z from the solid surface. The large magnitude of \chi (z) indicates the presence of long-ranged TCs. They observed a distinct peak near surfaces, even for those with contact angles as less as 26^{o}. These results show that TCs can contribute to the solid-liquid interfacial properties. In the paragraphs below we explain how TCs may affect the temperature dependence of  s-l interfacial free energies.}

\label{ID_19652608}\subsubsection{Solvation and capillary waves}

\label{ID_106467715}\paragraph{Consider the change in the free energy of a system when a l-v interface of a solvent is brought in contact with a solute that is fixed in space. Let the entire system be in gran canonical ensemble. Therefore difference in free energy is given as follows:}

\label{ID_1903608681}\paragraph{Here the superscripts f and i denote the state with solute in contact with l-v interface and the one where it is in contact with saturated vapor, respectively. Let us denote all the similar differences in extensive quantities by operator Delta,. Following from the second law, the above equation can then be written in a differential form as follows:}

\label{ID_1377597507}\paragraph{We assume here that the solvent is at liquid-vapor coexistence conditions and that the system is at constant volume. Then the temperature derivative of free energy is given by}

\label{ID_863437212}\paragraph{Note that if the l-v interface was initially not influenced by any external field, then under saturation condition, the free energy change due to its rise upto the solute will be zero. In other words \Delta \mu above, only represents the change due to solute. Therefore \Delta S and \Delta N_s_o_l are mainly due to the fixed solute. The entropy change may be further divided into the contributions coming from the solute itself (i), solute-solvent interactions (uv) and solvent-solvent interactions (v v). The first part depends on the temperature and the intramolecular interactions of the solute. The second part consists of fluctuations in the solute-solvent interaction energy. The final part is due to the changes in the solvent-solvent interactions that are brought about by the solute. Note that the \Delta S_{uv} also contains the indirect effect of solvent-solvent changes on solute-solvent fluctuations. Typically, the "structural" changes in the solvent brought about by the solute are included in the third term, whereas the "effect of fluctuations in the solvent" is accounted in the second term. The density-density correlations along liquid-vapor interface are "fluctuations" and therefore they contrubte to the second term.}

\label{ID_1074911865}\paragraph{Since the free energy change associated with the rise of liquid-vapor interface is zero, we can look at the above process in terms of inserting a solute at the position r in the existing liquid-vapor interface. The related free energy change and its temperature derivative is given as follows:}

\label{ID_388366021}\paragraph{Here v_{\Psi} denotes the partial derivative of the solute-solvent interaction potential with respect to the coupling parameter \lambda. Note that \rho_v (r_1 , r) denotes the density of the vapor around the solute molecule at the initial state corresponding to \Omega_i (r). Starting from the above expressions, \delta S can be expressed as follows: Here, &lt;...&gt; denote the sensemble average taken over the entire system and &lt;..&gt;_1 denote the average taken over a system with solvent molecule fixed at r_1.  Note that \Phi and V are the contributions from the solvent-solvent interactions and solute-solvent interactions, respectively. M denotes the contributions from the chemical potential of the solvent . [TO CHECK: From our previous calculations with water and a model solvent, we observed that the for different distances from the solute \Phi and V are negligible within simulation uncertainties or very small.]}

\label{ID_349834534}\paragraph{The superscripte v denote the same quantities for the initial state. We are assuming here that the solute is fixed and its internal degrees of freedom are not influenced by temperature. Also, we can express M in terms of density-density correlations. The different entropy components can then be expressed as follows: Where, \chi (r_1) is the local compressibility of the solvent at position r_1. Again, the superscripts  refer to the quantity corresponding to the initial state.}

\label{ID_1103070320}\paragraph{In order to understand the second term, We note that \Delta N_{sol} is also related to the compressibility of the solvent at the liquid-vapor interface as follows (refer cap_wave_fields2):  This can be easily derived from the above equations. Since the function v_{\Psi} strongly decreases with the distance from the solute, and the solute is positioned at the liquid-vapor interface, all the integrals above are mostly influenced by solvent moleculecules near the solute.}

\label{ID_1305040262}\paragraph{ It is known that the major contributon to \chi comes from transverse correlations along liquid-vapor interface, so called capillary waves. Therefore CWs affect the temperature dependence predominantly via the terms containing \chi as follows: Further observe that the effect is related to how liquid-vapor saturation properties of the solvent change with temperature. [TO CHECK: For studies with water and a model solvent, we did observe that unlike other terms, this term is statistically significant. Thus, transverse correlations play an important role in the temperature dependence of the free energy change associated with a single solute fixed at the liquid-vapor interface.]}

\label{ID_276381896}\paragraph{ We now turn towards solid surfaces. In the above equations, the solute acts as a static field and therefore, they are even valid for more than one solute molecule fixed at different locations in space. As we gradually increase the density of the solute molecules, the "liquid-vapor interface" will start  resembling the solid surface more. The free energgy change \Delta \mu can then be expressed as follows: Here A is the interfacial area and \gamma_{ij} represents the interfacial free energies between phases i and j. Therefore, to understand the temperature dependence of \gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl} for anatomistically detailed solid surface, we should analyze the terms in the above expressions}

\label{ID_374576713}\subsection{Research status (national)}

\label{ID_1169605654}\subsubsection{The group headed by Jayant Singh at IIT Kanpur used molecular simulations to study equilibrium and dynamic aspects of the wetting behavior. Over the years, they have studied the influence of surface roughness [J. Phys. Chem. C 118, 4113] and the chemical nature of surface [Fluid Phase Equilibria 302 (2011) 310–315] on the equilibrium wetting behavior. Most studies have employed the nanodroplet approach mentioned earlier and MD simulations to calculate contact angles for realistic models of liquids and surfaces. Some of their studies have also looked at the fundamental aspects of wetting transitions by tracking the growth of a liquid film via MC simulations [J. Phys. Chem. C 2011, 115, 17861–17869]. Recently, they and the collaborators looked at the thermal response of wetting behavior of water on a solid surface grafted with thermo-responsive polymer [Soft Matter, 2016,12, 3093-3102]. As noted earlier, such phenomena are due to the combined effects of rearrangement of surface molecules and the change in surface-fluid interactions. The work proposed in this document will be complementary to those studies because we will study only the effect of solid-fluid interaction usng surfaces whose molecules do not rearrange with temperature. Regarding the temperature dependence, Jayant Singh and collaborators have also studied the relation between wetting of water on nano-patterned surfaces and the nucleation of ice [Appl. Phys. Lett. 104, 021603 (2014)]. Though the proposed study will be concerned with fluids away from their triple point, we envision that nucleation can influence design decisions in the potential technologies involving wetting at different temperatures.}

\label{ID_1523203023}\subsubsection{We expect that the insights obtained from the proposed project will aid in rational design of solid surfaces with desired wetting behavior. The work of Indian researchers involved in fabricating such surfaces will be crucial for the real-world application of our ideas. Here, I will briefly describe the developments of some Indian research groups that are very relevant to the proposed project. At CSIR National Aerospace Laboratories, Harish Barshilia and co-workers are involved in fabrication and characterization of nano-patterned surfaces for different applications. Though most of these surfaces are developed with th the goal of improving the photocatalysis [Solar Energy Materials &amp; Solar Cells (2012), 107, 219-224], they have also reported the wetting properties of some of them [Vacuum (2014), 99, 42-48 2)],[ Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Letters, Volume 5, Number 8, August 2013, pp. 842-849(8)]. An important part of their work is to study the thermal and mechanical stability of the resulting surfaces or coatings [Surface &amp; Coatings Technology 288 (2016) 95–104]. This is particularly important for improving the applicability of such surfaces in commercial technologies. Also, such "rigid" surfaces are similar to to ones that we plan to use in the proposed project. The Thematic Unit of Excellence for Nanofabrication at IIT Kanpur is involved in bottom-up as well as top-down approaches for fabricating solid surfaces with nanoscopic features. Among the participating groups, the one headed by Ashutosh Sharma is involved in creating nanostructures by exploiting the dewetting properties of thin ploymer films [Langmuir 2015 31 (45), 12505-12511]. Importantly, the process also involves the variation of the temperature of the system. We therefore think that insights into the thermal response of wetting behavior can help in achieving a finer control over the nanoscale features produced by such processes. Another group headed by Krishnacharya Khare is designing surfaces which can be tuned to achieve desired wetiing behavior by liquids. This group uses patterning by polymers or inorganic materials like titania, or both to control the wetting response [Applied Surface Science 292 (2014) 777–781]. The techniques used and developed by them are relevant to our work. Especially, the proposed project will also use nanopatterned titania surfaces to tune the wetting behavior by using radiation.}

\label{ID_1615838882}\section{Work plan}

\label{ID_392987275}\subsection{Collection of data for (\gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl}) and \frac{d(\gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl})}{dT}. The objective here is to determine the trends in the above properties with respect to the parameters related to the solid surface. Experiments will be used to understand the effect of features that can be manipulated on a larger scale (greater than 100nm). The properties at the scale between few nanometers to hundreds of nanometers will be computed from well tested theoretical models. Molecular simulations will be used for features present from the atomistic scale to few nanometers where deviations from the common theoretical models are observed. In the molecular simulation studies, the focus will be more on the variation of the abovementioned properties with features of the solid surface instead of quantitative comparison with real systems. Therefore, the choice of models used for simulations and the employed system conditions will depend on the computational feasibility.}

\label{ID_116998146}\subsubsection{We describe here the information that we plan to obtain from these studies. Let us denote the three surface features by capital letters A, B and C. A "feature" may be related to a particular characteristic of the surface like overall solid-fluid interaction or roughness. A particular feature may be manipulated by changing certain characteristics of the surface. For example, roughness may be manipulated by considering solid surfaces with different roughness factors. Let us say that the number of systems that are used to study the trends with respect to features A, B and C be denoted by a, b and c, respectively. Our first aim is then to collect the data to be represented on the plot of \frac{d(\gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl})}{dT} vs \gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl} as shown in the adjacent [figure]. In this figure, the points A_{1} to A_{a} represent the data obtained for 'a' systems for determining the effect of surface feature A and, so on. These 'a' points will contain data from simulations as well as experiments depending on the scale at which the feature A is investigated. For example, if A is surface roughness then molecular simulations will be used to study the effect on roughness at scales smaller than few nanometers whereas experiments will be used for larger scales. Also note that the data may contain the results obtained at different temperatures and for different fluids. The data as represented in the [figure] can then help us to characterize the trends observed in  ( \gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl},frac{d(\gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl})}{dT}) by manipulating each feature. Each of the "features" that we mentioned above are broad categories that can be manipulated by changing different surface characteristics. For example, a rough surface contains  different surface features like hills and valleys. The roughness feature can then be manipulated by changing the depth of the valleys or by changing the spacing between hills. If the points obtained by changing the former characteristic lie on a particular curve on the adjacent diagram then those obtained by changing later characteristic may follow a different curve. This is represented in the adjacent plot where the curves l_{1}^A and l_{2}^B represent the trends obtained by manipulating feature A in two different ways. From the collected data we want to identify such profiles that will help us identify the characteristics of the surface that needs to be modified to vary  \gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl} and frac{d(\gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl})}{dT} in a particular manner. Since the data also contains the information obtained from different fluids and at diiferent temperatures, the analysis will also provide insights into the variation of the above properties with fluid nature and temperature. Though the main goal of this project is to understand the effect of solid surface, we plan to obtain results with few fluids to undderstand the variation with fluid nature. Typically, these fluids will differ in the proportion of electrostatic and dispersion interactions between theire molecules or ions. For example, experiments will be performed using fluids like hexadecane (lacking electrostatic interactions), water (both electrostatic and nonelectrostatic) and room temperature ionic liquids (electrostatic interactions are dominating). Coming to the molecular simulations, we will use fluid models with different proportion of electrostatic and dispersion interactions. These models will mostly contain monoatomic particles interacting with electrostatic and non-electrostatic interactions, the parameters of which will vary for different fluids. The choice of such a simple model of fluid has two advantages: 1) It ensures that only the "type" of fluid-fluid interaction is considered and excludes the effects due to changes in structure of molecules that are always present when real fluids like water or hexadecane are used. 2) The properties can be computed with lower computational expenses, which is important because we are interested in studying wide variety of systems in this project.  In the following paragraphs we describe the main surface features that we will look at.}

\label{ID_1369049574}\subsubsection{Attraction between the solid surface and fluid. Here the effect of attraction between the molecules of fluid and those of the solid surface will be studied for homogeneous surfaces. The measurements or computations will be performed using single crystal surfaces with different orientations. The interaction between the fluid and surface-atoms will be modified using suitable approaches.  The solid surfaces will be single crystal surfaces of compounds like TiO2 and ZnO. The chemical nature of these surfaces can be tuned by using a suitable radiation. Moreover, the effect of such modification on the  wetting behavior has been demonstrated. For example, exposure to UV radiation makes the solid surface more hydrophilic. Regarding molecular simulations, the solid surfaces will be crystalline and made of monatomic particles. With the techniques to be described later, we can manipulate the interaction between atoms of solid surface and those of fluid molecules to cover all the wetting regimes, from complete drying to complete wetting.}

\label{ID_708499358}\subsubsection{Roughness of the solid surface. The solid surface can be rough at multiple scales. At the lowest scale, the arrangement of molecules on the face of the crystal can be said to characterize a particular form of roughness. In order to study the effect of such roughness, the studies performed in the earlier paragraph will employ solid crystals with different orientation of surface atoms ( say 100, 110 or 001 crystal faces). For larger scale roughness, the experimental system will depend on the scale that is targeted. Note that all the solid surfaces below are "rigid", that is the relative positions of surface molecules is negligibly affected by the liquid or the investigated range of temperatures. We plan to account for the flexibility of the surface and consider surfaces made of thermoresponsive polymers in the future work. In later section we describe the specific tests that will be used to ensure the rigidity of these surfaces. [Advances in Colloids and Interface Science, 227, 57 (2016)]. The solid surfaces will be made of TiO2, ZnO and SiO2 and patterned using plasma [Vacuum (2014), 99, 42-48 2)] or chemical itching [PNAS, 105, 18200 (2008) ]. The duration of the itching process and the conditions employed will enable us to control the roughness. Most of these patterns will lack regular geometric features as shown in [figure]. However, using silica substrates we plan to study few surfaces with regular microscopic patterns as shown in the adjacent [figure]. The use of materials like TiO2 and ZnO will also enable us to vary the interaction between the surface atoms and those of the liquid (see previous section). The scale of features that we expect to study in experimental systems will range from 100nm to few micrometers. Coming to lower scales, It has been shown that the wetting behavior observed for features less than few tens of nanometers is significantly different [Langmuir, 29, 11815 (2013)]. For these scales we will use molecular simulations. The solid used in molecular simulations will be crystalline (FCC, BCC etc.) and made of monoatomic molecules. If the solid surface lies in x-y plane, then the surface patterns can be broadly chracterized into two types: 1) Those that vary along only 1 axis (stripped pattern) and 2) Those that vary along both x and y axes (chessboard pattern).  Note that in molecular simulations, the features are always periodic at macroscopic scale. In each of these categories we will consider features with two different shapes: 1) Sinusoidal and 2) rectangular. The studies will be performed for different characteristic dimensions of each of the above four types of patterns. For example, for the rectangular features, we will repeat the studies for different spacings between the pillars and different heights of the pillars.  Additionally, as in the previous section, we will also see the effect of varying solid-fluid interaction strengths using advanced simulation techniques.}

\label{ID_555034144}\subsubsection{Chemically heterogeous solid surfaces. We first discuss the surfaces for experimental studies. At the atomistic level, chemical heterogeneity is synonimous with the structure of individual molecules forming the surface and their arrangement in crystal. Hence, the measurements to be performed for different crystal faces of TiO2 (see earlier section) will also include the effect of chemical heterogeneity. It is also possible to produce chemical heterogeneity at similar or slightly larger scales by using surfaces made of block co-polymers or by chemical functionalization. However, the rigidity of such surfaces remains to be tested and we expect that their properties will be significantly affected by temperature. Therefore, we will not investigate such heterogeneity in the current project. For scales ranging from 100nm to few mictrometers, we will use TiO2 and ZnO surfaces that are made heterogeneous by selective exosure to radiation. Studies will be performed with two types of patterns : 1) Stripped and 2) Chess board, as shown in the adjacent figure. For each type, we will also consider different dimensions of the features. Turning to molecular simulations, we will use them to cover the features ranging from atomic scale to few nanometers. The solid surface will be crystalline and made of monoatomic molecules. In order to study the atomic scale heterogeneity, we will use different interaction parameters for the atoms  in the liquid-facing part of a unit cell [figure]. On larger scales, we will again consider stripped and chessboard patterns with different dimensions of the features. In this project, the patterns will contain regions of  two types that are distinguished by the interaction parameters between solid and fluid. The patternns containg refions of more than two ctypes will be considered in future studies following the development of computationally effecient methods to handle such scenarios.}

\label{ID_1874909901}\subsubsection{In this section we describe the methods that will be used to compute \gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl} and \frac{d(\gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl})}{dT} from molecular simulations. As described earlier, the ojective of this study is to understand the variation in the above properties with the properties of the surface, and not the quantitative comparison with experimental studies. Most of the studies will be conducted by using Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm via a free-energy based approach. In this approach we compute the interfacial free energies like \gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl} and \gamma_{lv} from the probability distributions that are collected from the simulations. These distributions are collected as a function of suitable order parameter like number of fluid molecules or solid-fluid interaction strength \epsilon_{sw}. The systsem that is simulated is shown in the adjacent [figure]. The simulation cell is parallelopiped and is bounded by the solid surface of interest on the lower side and a control wall on the upper side. The nature of the control-wall is described below. The simulation is performed such that  cell is periodic in the x and y directions along the plane of the solid surface. Note that the positions of the molecules of the surface are fixed during the simulation because we will only study the "rigid" surfaces.  For the fluid molecules, we will work in grand canonical ensemble (GC) where we fix the temperature T, volume of the cell V and the chemical potential of the fluid \mu. Since the study assumes that the liquid and vapor are in coexistence, we fix \mu corresponding to this condition. We then collect the probability distribution over the number of molecules of the fluid inside the cell. In this particular setup, when number of molecules is less, the configuration corresponds to the vapor in contact with the surface. Large number corresponds to a liquid slab attached to one of the two surfaces. Depending on the order parameter used to collect free energies, the simulations may be classified into two types: 1) Direct simulations and 2) Expanded ensemble simulations}

\label{ID_98441297}\paragraph{Direct simulations. Here the main order parameter is the number of molecules of the fluid. GC simulations are performed using the abovementioned setup. These may be further divided into two types depending on the nature of the control wall. In our simulations, the ccontrol wall is an external fiel that acts over a very small range and is not atomistically detailed.  Typically, its influence extends to only few molecular diameters away from it. If the interaction strength of this wall with the fluid \epsilon_{cw} is much greater than that of soldi surface \epsilon_{sw} then we refer to such simulations as drying simulations. On the other hand, if \epsilon_{cw} &lt;&lt; \epsilon_{sw} then the simulations are called spresding simulations. In the former case, the liquid slab "grows" on the controll wall and in the later case, it grows on the solid surface of interest. The probability distribution collected from this simulations is used to compute interface potential V(N).  as shown in the adjacent [figure] along with the snapshots of the simulation cell. The different parts of the profile are proportioanal to interfacial free energies as follows: For spreading simulation: Here, A is the cross-setional area of the simulation cell and C_{spread} is a constant depending on the cell geometry.  Similarly for drying simulations: Both these simulations are performed for a a particular surface and \gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl} and \gamma_{lv} are obtained by the solving the above system of equations. Once \gamma _{lv} at a particular temperature is known, one can then proceed with only one of the abovementioned simulations to calculate \gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl} for other surfaces. For technical reasons, spreading simulations are preferred for solid surfaces with stronger attraction towards fluid molecules, whereas drying simulations are used for weaker surfaces. However, performing direct simulations on different surefaces is computationally expensive, especially since we want to scan a broad range of surface characteristics.}
