\label{ID_896680657}\paragraph{The role of TCs in the temperature dependence of the wetting behavior can be understood in two ways. First, by looking at the contribution of CWs to the interfacial free energies at liquid-vapor-like interfaces. CWs are the undulations of the liquid-vapor interface in the direction perpendicular to the macroscopic interface which result in long-ranged TCs along the l-v interface. Let us say that our system is 3D with l-v interface in x-y plane, then the l-v interface for a particular confguration of molecules can be defined as z = \xi (x,y). Let z = 0 then represent the averaged l-v interface . The undulations of this surface is then analyzed by performing the spectral analysis of \xi as follows: Here, r is the vector  in the x-y plane. As k increases, the corresponding terms denote the contributions from the undulations of short wavelength. The capillary wave theory, defines the CWs as the undulations of very large wavelength, that is k \rightarrow 0. The macroscopic surface tension  \sigma can be expressed as the sum of the "bulk " surface tension  \sigma_b and the one coming from the CWs \sigma_c. [Refer Phys. Rev. A, 33, 1948 (1986)] It is expected that \sigma_c &lt; 0 because undulations are entropically favorable and they decrease the interfacial free energy.  It is also possible to express a \lambda-dependent surface tension \sigma_{\lambda} which excludes the contributions from undulations above a particular wavelenght \lambda}

\label{ID_49666523}\paragraph{Kayser theoretically analyzed \sigma_{\lambda} for temperatures near triple point of liquids and those near critical point. He observed that near the triple point, when \lambda is about 10 times the molecular diameter, \sigma_{\lambda} is about 15% higher than the macroscopic value. For temperatures near Tc, the similar increase of 15% is obtained if \lambda is 20 times the molecular diameter. The contributions from undulations of larger wavelength were also found to be important in different experimental studies [ Nature, 403, 871 (2000) ]. Here, \sigma_{\lambda} was computed from the scattering intensity obtained from a carefully performed X-ray diffraction study of the l-v interface. A more thorough analysis of the temperature dependence of \sigma_{\lambda} was recently performed by Hoefling and Dietrich using molecular simulations. [EPL, 109, 46002]. They observed that the ratio \sigma_{\lambda}/\sigma is significantly altered with temperature. There observations have also been supported by the theoretical study performed by Parry, Rascon and Evans.}

\label{ID_6364435}\paragraph{ Excluding wavelengths greater than \lambda is same as restricting or pinning the l-v interface at distances separated by \lambda along xy plane. (See Adjacent figure). The conclusions from the above studies then imply that surface tension of such a pinned interface shows a different temperature dependence than that of the unpinned or free interface. In real systems, such a pinned interface can be realized in several scenarios like liquid-vapor interface confined inside a nanopore or the interface pinned between the colloidal particles. With regards to wetting, such a scenario also exists on certain solid surfaces. For example, several designs of superhydrophobic or superoleophobic surfaces have protruding stuctures having dimensions between micrometers and nanometers. When liquid sits at the top of these pillars (Cassie regime) a pinned liquid-vapor interface exists between the pillars (See the adjacent figure). Note that the macroscopic solid-liquid interface now consists of the combination of several such pinned liquid-vapor interfaces. The theoretical predictions about the temperature dependence of \sigma_{\lambda} can therefore guide one to tune the distance between these pillars and their arrangement in two dimensions to obtain the desired thermal response of the wetting behavior.}

\label{ID_1590536878}\paragraph{For more general solid surfaces which do not have such structures, the above analysis cannot be used because there are no liquid-vapor-like interfaces near the solid surface. Also for the solid surfaces with pillars, it is only valid when the distance between the pillars is much larger than the molecular diameter of the liquid. Additionaly note that the analysis will be very complicated for the solid surfaces with flexible structures. If the attraction between molecules of solid surface and those of liquid is weak then long-ranged TCs do exist near solid surface. This was recently shown for water molecules near hydrophobic surfaces using molecular simulations [PRL, 115, 016103 (2015)]. In this work Wilding and Evans used quantity called local compressibility \chi as a function of the distance z from the solid surface. The large magnitude of \chi (z) indicates the presence of long-ranged TCs. They observed a distinct peak near surfaces, even for those with contact angles as less as 26^{o}. These results show that TCs can contribute to the solid-liquid interfacial properties. In the paragraphs below we explain how TCs may affect the temperature dependence of  s-l interfacial free energies.}

\label{ID_19652608}\subsubsection{Solvation and capillary waves}

\label{ID_106467715}\paragraph{Consider the change in the free energy of a system when a l-v interface of a solvent is brought in contact with a solute that is fixed in space. Let the entire system be in gran canonical ensemble. Therefore difference in free energy is given as follows:}

\label{ID_1903608681}\paragraph{Here the superscripts f and i denote the state with solute in contact with l-v interface and the one where it is in contact with saturated vapor, respectively. Let us denote all the similar differences in extensive quantities by operator Delta,. Following from the second law, the above equation can then be written in a differential form as follows:}

\label{ID_1377597507}\paragraph{We assume here that the solvent is at liquid-vapor coexistence conditions and that the system is at constant volume. Then the temperature derivative of free energy is given by}

\label{ID_863437212}\paragraph{Note that if the l-v interface was initially not influenced by any external field, then under saturation condition, the free energy change due to its rise upto the solute will be zero. In other words \Delta \mu above, only represents the change due to solute. Therefore \Delta S and \Delta N_s_o_l are mainly due to the fixed solute. The entropy change may be further divided into the contributions coming from the solute itself (i), solute-solvent interactions (uv) and solvent-solvent interactions (v v). The first part depends on the temperature and the intramolecular interactions of the solute. The second part consists of fluctuations in the solute-solvent interaction energy. The final part is due to the changes in the solvent-solvent interactions that are brought about by the solute. Note that the \Delta S_{uv} also contains the indirect effect of solvent-solvent changes on solute-solvent fluctuations. Typically, the "structural" changes in the solvent brought about by the solute are included in the third term, whereas the "effect of fluctuations in the solvent" is accounted in the second term. The density-density correlations along liquid-vapor interface are "fluctuations" and therefore they contrubte to the second term.}

\label{ID_1074911865}\paragraph{Since the free energy change associated with the rise of liquid-vapor interface is zero, we can look at the above process in terms of inserting a solute at the position r in the existing liquid-vapor interface. The related free energy change and its temperature derivative is given as follows:}

\label{ID_388366021}\paragraph{Here v_{\Psi} denotes the partial derivative of the solute-solvent interaction potential with respect to the coupling parameter \lambda. Note that \rho_v (r_1 , r) denotes the density of the vapor around the solute molecule at the initial state corresponding to \Omega_i (r). Starting from the above expressions, \delta S can be expressed as follows: Here, &lt;...&gt; denote the sensemble average taken over the entire system and &lt;..&gt;_1 denote the average taken over a system with solvent molecule fixed at r_1.  Note that \Phi and V are the contributions from the solvent-solvent interactions and solute-solvent interactions, respectively. M denotes the contributions from the chemical potential of the solvent . [TO CHECK: From our previous calculations with water and a model solvent, we observed that the for different distances from the solute \Phi and V are negligible within simulation uncertainties or very small.]}

\label{ID_349834534}\paragraph{The superscripte v denote the same quantities for the initial state. We are assuming here that the solute is fixed and its internal degrees of freedom are not influenced by temperature. Also, we can express M in terms of density-density correlations. The different entropy components can then be expressed as follows: Where, \chi (r_1) is the local compressibility of the solvent at position r_1. Again, the superscripts  refer to the quantity corresponding to the initial state.}

\label{ID_1103070320}\paragraph{In order to understand the second term, We note that \Delta N_{sol} is also related to the compressibility of the solvent at the liquid-vapor interface as follows (refer cap_wave_fields2):  This can be easily derived from the above equations. Since the function v_{\Psi} strongly decreases with the distance from the solute, and the solute is positioned at the liquid-vapor interface, all the integrals above are mostly influenced by solvent moleculecules near the solute.}

\label{ID_1305040262}\paragraph{ It is known that the major contributon to \chi comes from transverse correlations along liquid-vapor interface, so called capillary waves. Therefore CWs affect the temperature dependence predominantly via the terms containing \chi as follows: Further observe that the effect is related to how liquid-vapor saturation properties of the solvent change with temperature. [TO CHECK: For studies with water and a model solvent, we did observe that unlike other terms, this term is statistically significant. Thus, transverse correlations play an important role in the temperature dependence of the free energy change associated with a single solute fixed at the liquid-vapor interface.]}

\label{ID_276381896}\paragraph{ We now turn towards solid surfaces. In the above equations, the solute acts as a static field and therefore, they are even valid for more than one solute molecule fixed at different locations in space. As we gradually increase the density of the solute molecules, the "liquid-vapor interface" will start  resembling the solid surface more. The free energgy change \Delta \mu can then be expressed as follows: Here A is the interfacial area and \gamma_{ij} represents the interfacial free energies between phases i and j. Therefore, to understand the temperature dependence of \gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl} for anatomistically detailed solid surface, we should analyze the terms in the above expressions}
