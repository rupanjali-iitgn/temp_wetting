\label{ID_1490725096}\subsection{The interaction between a solid surface and a liquid plays an important role in several natural and synthetic processes. An important phenomena in such systems is the wetting of a solid surface by liquid. The technological advances have enabled the development and application of solid-liquid interfaces  of increasingly microscopic dimensions. Further, there is a great scope for fine-tuning the chemical nature of solid surface at the molecular scale to achieve desired wetting behavior. Theoretical studies and computer simulations can help guide such manipulation. In this particular project we focus on the temperature dependence of the solid-liquid interfacial properties. Specifically, we will employ statistical mechanics to design solid surfaces that show desired thermal response of wetting. This will be achieved with the help of advanced molecular simulation techniques.}

\label{ID_1521482540}\subsection{Broadly speaking, the temperature dependence of solid-liquid interfacial properties are important where the solid-liquid interface plays an important role. In microfluidics and nanofluidics wetting behavior is very important and there are numerous scenarios where such devices encounter environments with varying temperatures. For example, microfluidic devices used in processes involving endothermic or exothermic reactions. Another important application is the role of temperature in the wetting of ink droplets on solid surfaces. With the application of inkjet printing technology in areas like microelectronics and solarcells it becomes important to understand how the wetting behavior of ink droplets epends on temperature. The knowledge about dynamics of heat and mass transfer is indeed crucial in the development of such realistic systems. However, it is useful to first study such systems under equilibrium conditions to understand the factors that must be considered for designing them. Moreover, such a study can provide useul insights into the underlying molecular-scale phenomena. We explain this point with the example of thermal engines based on the wetting behavior of solids [AIChE, 49, 764 (2003)]. These engines are based on a thermodynamic cycle made of processes that involve the spreading of liquid on a solid surface and have applications in micro-mechanical actuators [Energy and Environmental Science, 4, 3632] and car dampers [J. of Automobile Engg., 221, pp. 301]. If one assumes that all the involved processes are reversible then it is straightforward to relate the technologically relevant quantities of the engine to molecular-level details of the system. For example, the exchange of work and heat with the surroundings is related to the interfacial free energies (solid-liquid, liquid-vapor and solid-vapor) and their derivatives with respect to temperature, respectively. Using the framework of statistical mechanics these quantities can be further related to the chemical nature of solid surface and liquid. Thus, by designing solid surfaces that result in the desired thermal response of the wetting behavior one can, in principle, develop wetting engines having desired efficiency.}

\label{ID_412834846}\subsection{With regards to the nature of solid surface, there are several factors that can potentially affect solid-fluid interfacial free energiesand their temperature derivatives. In this project we are partiularly interested in the effect of heterogenity along the plane of the solid surface. Such a heterogenity can be due to the variation of the chemical nature or due to the surface roughness. Moreover,  it can range over multiple scales. For example, roughness can be considered at the atomistic level due to a particular arrangement of surface atoms, whereas at larger scales it can be due to variation in the macroscopic topography of the surface. Such heterogeneity affects the solid-fluid interfacial properties by influencing the correlations between local densities of the fluid molecules along the plane parallel to the surface. Therefore, in order to rationally design such a heterogeneous surface it is important to understand the contribution of abovementioned correlations to solid-fluid interfacial free energies and their derivatives with respect to temperature. In this document we refer the density-density correlations in liquid along liquid-vapor or solid-liquid interfaces as transevrse correlations (abbreviated as TC)}

\label{ID_350936959}\subsection{The important objectives of this project can be summarised as follows:}

\label{ID_1343604658}\subsubsection{Using molecular simulations to systematically understand the contribution of TCs along liquid-vapor or solid-liquid interfaces to interfacial free energies and their derivatives with respect to temperature.}

\label{ID_1036554838}\subsubsection{Using simulations to understand how the molecules of the solid surface affect the TCs. Here, we will study the effect of their chemical nature as well as their arrangement on the surface}

\label{ID_1671481601}\subsubsection{Qualitatively compare the above predictions with the results from experiments}

\label{ID_1110611260}\section{Background}

\label{ID_1392626561}\subsection{Research status (international)}

\label{ID_688891944}\subsubsection{Theoretical}

\label{ID_1917907773}\paragraph{The temperature dependence of wetting phenomenon has been closely connected with the study of wetting  from the perspective of phase coexistence. Basically, one can consider the two scenarios: 1) a solid-vapor interface being partially wet by the liquid and 2) solid-vapor interface being completely wet by the liquid as two surface "phases". Similar to coexistence between say liquid and vapor these two surface phases can be in coexistence at certain system parametrers. The parameters of interest are temperature or those related to the nature of the solid surface like the strength of interaction between solid and liquid, surface roughness etc. Analogous to wetting transitions, one may consider drying transitions where the role of liquid and vapor in the above tweo scfenarios are interchanged. [The adjacent figure 1 denotes the wetting and drying transitions]}

\label{ID_1762818689}\paragraph{In1977 Cahn proposed that there exists a temperature below the critical temperature of fluid at which the wetting transition on a given solid surface occurs. The argument was based on the comparison between the temperature dependence of \gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl}  and that of \gamma_{lv}. Cahn used a theoretical approach called as square-gradient version of Van der Waals theory and did not consider the atrraction between solid and liquid in explicit detail.}

\label{ID_1622008046}\paragraph{Later, the square-gradient theory was modified by Nakanishi and Fisher to include the dependence of solid-fluid attraction. Specifically, Nakanishi and Fisher proposed a phase diagram which represented the coexistence lines for the wetting and drying transitions in the plot of temperature vs a parameter denoting the strength of solid-fluid interaction. Their phase diagram shows that for weak solid-liquid interaction, increase in temperature brings the system closer to drying transition. Whereas for strong solid-fluid interactions, increase in temperature brings the system closer to the wetting transition. It should be noted, however, that  these theories do not consider the molecualr-level details of the solid surface or liquid. Therefore, the observations do not provide quantitative predictions of the wetting behavior in real systems.. Secondly, the above studies only understand the behavior of systems "at" the wetting and drying transitions. From a technological perspective, it is also important to understand the temperature dependence of contact angles in the partial wetting regime.}

\label{ID_1378614173}\paragraph{Another theoretical approach that is applied to understand the wetting behavior is claasical Density Functional theory (DFT). This theory considers molecular-level details of the system but is computationally less expensive as compared to molecular simulations. It considers the system in grand canonical ensemble and expresses the grand potential as a functional of the space-dependent density of the fluid. The equilibrium density of the fluid is calculated by minimizing the grand potential. The interfacial free energies like \gamma_{sv} \gamma_{sl} and \gamma_{lv} are then obtained from the equilibrium density profile via the graand potential. Though this approach can be only used for very simple systems, it is able to provide qualitative understanding of the observations in real systems}

\label{ID_53484468}\paragraph{One of the first applications of DFT to study wetting behavior is by Sullivan (J. Chem Phys, 74, 2601) who employed the Van der Vaals theory without the square-gradient approximation. Particularly, the Cahn's definition of solid surface was reinterpreted in terms of a more realistic solid-fluid interaction potential. This enabled Sullivan to study the variation of contact angle theta over a range of solid-fluid interaction strengths (\epsilo_w ). at multiple temperatures. It was observed that for small \epsilon_{w} - where theta is large - \theta increased with temperature. On the other hand, for large \epsilon_{w} \theta decreased with temperature. Similar influence of solid-fluid interactions on the temperature dependence of \theta was also observed in more recent DFT studies. Kuiper and Blokhuis (J. Chem. Phys, 131, 044702 (2009)) used DFT to reinterpret the square-gradient model of Nakanishi and Fisher described earlier in terms of the realistic solid-fluid interactions. In addition to verifying the phase diagram of wetting and drying transitions as observed by Nakanishi and Fisher, they computed the contact angles for a wide range of substrate-fluid interaction strengths \epsilon_{w}. Here, \epsilon_{w} was characterized by the depth of square-well potential between solid and fluid. As in study of Sullivan, contact angles increased with temperature for small \epsilon_{w} whereas, opposite trnd was observed for large \epsilo_{w}. Recently, Berim and Ruckenstein employed the canonical version of DFT to study the temperature dependence of contact angles over a range of substrate-fluid interaction strengths. The system they studied was a liquid drop on a solid surface instead of a liquid film in contact with surface as studied by earlier mentioned works. The contact angle was also measured visually at the three phase contact line. Their solid surface was more realistic than the earlier studies and consisted of discrete molecules interacting with fluid molecules via Lennard Jones potential. The LJ parameter for the solid-fluid interaction \epsilon_{sf} characterized the substrate-fluid interaction strength. Like earlier studies, they observed that \theta increased with temperature for low \epsilon_{sf} whereas opposite trends were observed for larg \epsilo_{sf}. The notable distinction from the earlier studies was that the transition from the former regime to the later regime happened over a very narrow range of \epsilo_{sf}. Berim and Ruckenstein commented on the significance of the intermediate substrate-strength \epsilon_{sf}^o at which the \theta is almost independent of temperature. The above studies indicate that the temperature dependence of \theta show some general trends with respect to the strength of attraction between surface and fluid, irrespective of the actual form of interaction potential. That being said, the complexity of systems that can be handled using DFT is limited. Especially, the heterogeneity of the solid surface that may play an important role in the wetting behavior was not considered.}

\label{ID_678529580}\paragraph{Still  the complexity of systems limited}

\label{ID_869146050}\subsubsection{Experimental}

\label{ID_566286120}\paragraph{Early work on understanding phase transition considered temperature dependence (Refer the review by Bonn and Ross). However the systems were limited and also the work considered the growth of the liquid films.  Very few works considered the variation of surface-fluid interaction.}

\label{ID_1447496666}\paragraph{Drying transition not been detected using Experiments. However, the depletion of liquid density near the solid surfaces of very weak strengths has been observed. Refer 1) Hess et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 78, 1739 (1997) where the depletion of Ne liquid density on Cs surface was onbserved 2)Jensen et al. Phys. Rev. Lett., 90, 086101 (2003) also observed similar depletion of water near hydrophobic surface with Xray reflectiveity studies. They also correlated their observations with contact angle measurements 3) Langmuir, 23, 598 (2007) used neutron diffraction to observe similar depletion between water and hydrophobic solid surface.}

\label{ID_1486553890}\paragraph{It should be noted that studies were performed with wetting of a liquid on another liquid to understand temperature dependence near wetting transitions}

\label{ID_121688724}\paragraph{Neumann and colleagues performed extensive measurements on the temperature dependence of wetting behavior of different polymer surfaces. The srface characteristics that they focussed on included the overall nature of the surface and  not the microscopic details.}

\label{ID_1942058277}\subsubsection{Theoretical}

\label{ID_896680657}\paragraph{The role of TCs in the temperature dependence of the wetting behavior can be understood in two ways. First, by looking at the contribution of CWs to the interfacial free energies at liquid-vapor-like interfaces. CWs are the undulations of the liquid-vapor interface in the direction perpendicular to the macroscopic interface which result in long-ranged TCs along the l-v interface. Let us say that our system is 3D with l-v interface in x-y plane, then the l-v interface for a particular confguration of molecules can be defined as z = \xi (x,y). Let z = 0 then represent the averaged l-v interface . The undulations of this surface is then analyzed by performing the spectral analysis of \xi as follows: Here, r is the vector  in the x-y plane. As k increases, the corresponding terms denote the contributions from the undulations of short wavelength. The capillary wave theory, defines the CWs as the undulations of very large wavelength, that is k \rightarrow 0. The macroscopic surface tension  \sigma can be expressed as the sum of the "bulk " surface tension  \sigma_b and the one coming from the CWs \sigma_c. [Refer Phys. Rev. A, 33, 1948 (1986)] It is expected that \sigma_c &lt; 0 because undulations are entropically favorable and they decrease the interfacial free energy.  It is also possible to express a \lambda-dependent surface tension \sigma_{\lambda} which excludes the contributions from undulations above a particular wavelenght \lambda}

\label{ID_49666523}\paragraph{Kayser theoretically analyzed \sigma_{\lambda} for temperatures near triple point of liquids and those near critical point. He observed that near the triple point, when \lambda is about 10 times the molecular diameter, \sigma_{\lambda} is about 15% higher than the macroscopic value. For temperatures near Tc, the similar increase of 15% is obtained if \lambda is 20 times the molecular diameter. The contributions from undulations of larger wavelength were also found to be important in different experimental studies [ Nature, 403, 871 (2000) ]. Here, \sigma_{\lambda} was computed from the scattering intensity obtained from a carefully performed X-ray diffraction study of the l-v interface. A more thorough analysis of the temperature dependence of \sigma_{\lambda} was recently performed by Hoefling and Dietrich using molecular simulations. [EPL, 109, 46002]. They observed that the ratio \sigma_{\lambda}/\sigma is significantly altered with temperature. There observations have also been supported by the theoretical study performed by Parry, Rascon and Evans.}

\label{ID_6364435}\paragraph{ Excluding wavelengths greater than \lambda is same as restricting or pinning the l-v interface at distances separated by \lambda along xy plane. (See Adjacent figure). The conclusions from the above studies then imply that surface tension of such a pinned interface shows a different temperature dependence than that of the unpinned or free interface. In real systems, such a pinned interface can be realized in several scenarios like liquid-vapor interface confined inside a nanopore or the interface pinned between the colloidal particles. With regards to wetting, such a scenario also exists on certain solid surfaces. For example, several designs of superhydrophobic or superoleophobic surfaces have protruding stuctures having dimensions between micrometers and nanometers. When liquid sits at the top of these pillars (Cassie regime) a pinned liquid-vapor interface exists between the pillars (See the adjacent figure). Note that the macroscopic solid-liquid interface now consists of the combination of several such pinned liquid-vapor interfaces. The theoretical predictions about the temperature dependence of \sigma_{\lambda} can therefore guide one to tune the distance between these pillars and their arrangement in two dimensions to obtain the desired thermal response of the wetting behavior.}

\label{ID_1590536878}\paragraph{For more general solid surfaces which do not have such structures, the above analysis cannot be used because there are no liquid-vapor-like interfaces near the solid surface. Also for the solid surfaces with pillars, it is only valid when the distance between the pillars is much larger than the molecular diameter of the liquid. Additionaly note that the analysis will be very complicated for the solid surfaces with flexible structures. If the attraction between molecules of solid surface and those of liquid is weak then long-ranged TCs do exist near solid surface. This was recently shown for water molecules near hydrophobic surfaces using molecular simulations [PRL, 115, 016103 (2015)]. In this work Wilding and Evans used quantity called local compressibility \chi as a function of the distance z from the solid surface. The large magnitude of \chi (z) indicates the presence of long-ranged TCs. They observed a distinct peak near surfaces, even for those with contact angles as less as 26^{o}. These results show that TCs can contribute to the solid-liquid interfacial properties. In the paragraphs below we explain how TCs may affect the temperature dependence of  s-l interfacial free energies.}

\label{ID_908289338}\paragraph{Write about studies that looked at the role of TDCs: 1) Velasco and Tarazona, J Chem Phys, 91,7916 (1989) 2) Oleinikova and Brovchenko, Phys. Rev. E, 76, 041603 (2007) and 3) Pleimling, Journal of Physics A, Mathematics and General, 37, R79 (2004)}

\label{ID_1933251243}\paragraph{TDCs have not been experimentally studied. However, experiments have detected the depletion of liquid density near weak solid surfaces. From simulation and theoretical studies, such depletion generally accompanies the increased local compressibility.  However, the actual range of TDCs via experiments remains to be understood. Drying transition not been detected using Experiments. However, the depletion of liquid density near the solid surfaces of very weak strengths has been observed. Refer 1) Hess et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 78, 1739 (1997) where the depletion of Ne liquid density on Cs surface was onbserved 2)Jensen et al. Phys. Rev. Lett., 90, 086101 (2003) also observed similar depletion of water near hydrophobic surface with Xray reflectiveity studies. They also correlated their observations with contact angle measurements 3) Langmuir, 23, 598 (2007) used neutron diffraction to observe similar depletion between water and hydrophobic solid surface. 4) Poynar et al. Phys. Rev. Lett.,97, 266101 (2006) using x-ray reflectivity measurements}

\label{ID_19652608}\subsubsection{Solvation and capillary waves}

\label{ID_106467715}\paragraph{Consider the change in the free energy of a system when a l-v interface of a solvent is brought in contact with a solute that is fixed in space. Let the entire system be in gran canonical ensemble. Therefore difference in free energy is given as follows:}

\label{ID_1903608681}\paragraph{Here the superscripts f and i denote the state with solute in contact with l-v interface and the one where it is in contact with saturated vapor, respectively. Let us denote all the similar differences in extensive quantities by operator Delta,. Following from the second law, the above equation can then be written in a differential form as follows:}

\label{ID_1377597507}\paragraph{We assume here that the solvent is at liquid-vapor coexistence conditions and that the system is at constant volume. Then the temperature derivative of free energy is given by}

\label{ID_863437212}\paragraph{Note that if the l-v interface was initially not influenced by any external field, then under saturation condition, the free energy change due to its rise upto the solute will be zero. In other words \Delta \mu above, only represents the change due to solute. Therefore \Delta S and \Delta N_s_o_l are mainly due to the fixed solute. The entropy change may be further divided into the contributions coming from the solute itself (i), solute-solvent interactions (uv) and solvent-solvent interactions (v v). The first part depends on the temperature and the intramolecular interactions of the solute. The second part consists of fluctuations in the solute-solvent interaction energy. The final part is due to the changes in the solvent-solvent interactions that are brought about by the solute. Note that the \Delta S_{uv} also contains the indirect effect of solvent-solvent changes on solute-solvent fluctuations. Typically, the "structural" changes in the solvent brought about by the solute are included in the third term, whereas the "effect of fluctuations in the solvent" is accounted in the second term. The density-density correlations along liquid-vapor interface are "fluctuations" and therefore they contrubte to the second term.}

\label{ID_1074911865}\paragraph{Since the free energy change associated with the rise of liquid-vapor interface is zero, we can look at the above process in terms of inserting a solute at the position r in the existing liquid-vapor interface. The related free energy change and its temperature derivative is given as follows:}

\label{ID_388366021}\paragraph{Here v_{\Psi} denotes the partial derivative of the solute-solvent interaction potential with respect to the coupling parameter \lambda. Note that \rho_v (r_1 , r) denotes the density of the vapor around the solute molecule at the initial state corresponding to \Omega_i (r). Starting from the above expressions, \delta S can be expressed as follows: Here, &lt;...&gt; denote the sensemble average taken over the entire system and &lt;..&gt;_1 denote the average taken over a system with solvent molecule fixed at r_1.  Note that \Phi and V are the contributions from the solvent-solvent interactions and solute-solvent interactions, respectively. M denotes the contributions from the chemical potential of the solvent . [TO CHECK: From our previous calculations with water and a model solvent, we observed that the for different distances from the solute \Phi and V are negligible within simulation uncertainties or very small.]}

\label{ID_349834534}\paragraph{The superscripte v denote the same quantities for the initial state. We are assuming here that the solute is fixed and its internal degrees of freedom are not influenced by temperature. Also, we can express M in terms of density-density correlations. The different entropy components can then be expressed as follows: Where, \chi (r_1) is the local compressibility of the solvent at position r_1. Again, the superscripts  refer to the quantity corresponding to the initial state.}

\label{ID_1103070320}\paragraph{In order to understand the second term, We note that \Delta N_{sol} is also related to the compressibility of the solvent at the liquid-vapor interface as follows (refer cap_wave_fields2):  This can be easily derived from the above equations. Since the function v_{\Psi} strongly decreases with the distance from the solute, and the solute is positioned at the liquid-vapor interface, all the integrals above are mostly influenced by solvent moleculecules near the solute.}

\label{ID_1305040262}\paragraph{ It is known that the major contributon to \chi comes from transverse correlations along liquid-vapor interface, so called capillary waves. Therefore CWs affect the temperature dependence predominantly via the terms containing \chi as follows: Further observe that the effect is related to how liquid-vapor saturation properties of the solvent change with temperature. [TO CHECK: For studies with water and a model solvent, we did observe that unlike other terms, this term is statistically significant. Thus, transverse correlations play an important role in the temperature dependence of the free energy change associated with a single solute fixed at the liquid-vapor interface.]}

\label{ID_276381896}\paragraph{ We now turn towards solid surfaces. In the above equations, the solute acts as a static field and therefore, they are even valid for more than one solute molecule fixed at different locations in space. As we gradually increase the density of the solute molecules, the "liquid-vapor interface" will start  resembling the solid surface more. The free energgy change \Delta \mu can then be expressed as follows: Here A is the interfacial area and \gamma_{ij} represents the interfacial free energies between phases i and j. Therefore, to understand the temperature dependence of \gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl} for anatomistically detailed solid surface, we should analyze the terms in the above expressions}
