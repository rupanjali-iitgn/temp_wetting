<node TEXT="The interaction between a solid surface and a liquid plays an important role in several natural and synthetic processes. An important phenomena in such systems is the wetting of a solid surface by liquid. The technological advances have enabled the development and application of solid-liquid interfaces  of increasingly microscopic dimensions. Further, there is a great scope for fine-tuning the chemical nature of solid surface at the molecular scale to achieve desired wetting behavior. Theoretical studies and computer simulations can help guide such manipulation. In this particular project we focus on the temperature dependence of the solid-liquid interfacial properties. Specifically, we will employ statistical mechanics to design solid surfaces that show desired thermal response of wetting. This will be achieved with the help of advanced molecular simulation techniques." ID="ID_1490725096" CREATED="1457086362062" MODIFIED="1459670006896" NUMBERED="true" MOVED="1463141805877"/>
<node TEXT="Broadly speaking, the temperature dependence of solid-liquid interfacial properties are important where the solid-liquid interface plays an important role. In microfluidics and nanofluidics wetting behavior is very important and there are numerous scenarios where such devices encounter environments with varying temperatures. For example, microfluidic devices used in processes involving endothermic or exothermic reactions. Another important application is the role of temperature in the wetting of ink droplets on solid surfaces. With the application of inkjet printing technology in areas like microelectronics and solarcells it becomes important to understand how the wetting behavior of ink droplets depends on temperature \cite{soltman2008inkjet}. The knowledge about dynamics of heat and mass transfer is indeed crucial in the development of such realistic systems. However, it is useful to first study such systems under equilibrium conditions to understand the factors that must be considered for designing them. Moreover, such a study can provide useul insights into the underlying molecular-scale phenomena. We explain this point with the example of thermal engines based on the wetting behavior of solids.\cite{AIC:AIC690490320} These engines are based on a thermodynamic cycle made of processes that involve the spreading of liquid on a solid surface and have applications in micro-mechanical actuators \cite{xu2011conceptual} and car dampers \cite{eroshenko2007new}. ."

<node TEXT="If one assumes that all the involved processes are reversible then it is straightforward to relate the technologically relevant quantities of the engine to molecular-level details of the system. For example, the exchange of work and heat with the surroundings is related to the interfacial free energies (solid-liquid, liquid-vapor and solid-vapor) and their derivatives with respect to temperature, respectively. Using the framework of statistical mechanics these quantities can be further related to the chemical nature of solid surface and liquid. Thus, by designing solid surfaces that result in the desired thermal response of the wetting behavior one can, in principle, develop wetting engines having desired efficiency" ID="ID_513104444" CREATED="1459694842459" MODIFIED="1459694858204" NUMBERED="true" MOVED="1463141805921"/>
<node TEXT="With regards to the nature of solid surface, there are several factors that can potentially affect solid-fluid interfacial free energiesand their temperature derivatives. In this project we are partiularly interested in the effect of heterogenity along the plane of the solid surface. Such a heterogenity can be due to the variation of the chemical nature or due to the surface roughness. Moreover,  it can range over multiple scales. For example, roughness can be considered at the atomistic level due to a particular arrangement of surface atoms, whereas at larger scales it can be due to variation in the macroscopic topography of the surface."

<node TEXT="The ability to manipulate the temperature dependence of wetting behavior has great potential in technologies as varied as ink-jet printing \cite{soltman2008inkjet} and car-dampers \cite{eroshenko2007new}. The advances in fabricating solid surfaces with nano-scale features \cite{su2015bio,lai2015recent} will play an important role in this endeavor. Most features make the solid surface heterogeneous along its plane, at scales ranging from few nanometers to few micrometers. In order to rationally design surfaces with  the desired temperature dependence of wetting behavior, it will be beneficial to study the interfacial properties that show spatial correlations along the plane of the interface. We explain the above point for a system at equilibrium using Figure \ref{repratdesign}. Here, the red, green and violet beads are used to denote the regions of the solid surface with different features. Each feature influences the local property of the interface (like density etc.), as denoted by the stars of same color. If the local properties of different colors are independent of each other, then the arrangement of features (spacing between beads of different colors) will not affect the macroscopic properties like interfacial free energies. On the other hand,  if they are correlated, then the potential for tuning the macroscopic properties by rearranging the surface features increases (note that the surface is two-dimensional). The &quot;rational design&quot; will involve predicting the macroscopic properties for a particular arrangement of the surface features. Such a prediction will be aided by the knowledge of correlation between local properties along the plane of the surface."

<node TEXT="The choice of the local property will depend on the macroscopic phenomena of interest and the scale of the surface features. Our  ultimate goal is to design nano-scale and micro-scale features on the solid surface to obtain the desired thermal response of the wetting behavior. Therefore, in the proposed project, the local property of interest is the fluctuation in the local density of liquid near the surface.  Such density-fluctuations are known to correlate over large distances along the interface \cite{rowlinson2013molecular} and influence the temperature dependence of interfacial free energies \cite{hofling2015enhanced}. In the rest of this proposal we refer the above correlations as transverse correlations (TCs). TCs near liquid-vapor interfaces have been extensively studied as capillary waves. Their spatial features are well known \cite{braslau1988capillary,stecki1996susceptibilities}, and their role in the temperature dependence of the interfacial free energy has been investigated \cite{hofling2015enhanced}. Theoretical studies and molecular simulations have shown that TCs are significant on the liquid side of certain solid-liquid interfaces \cite{evans2015quantifying}. However, their  spatial features and their contribution to the temperature dependence of solid-fluid interfacial free energies remain to be investigated. These questions will be addressed in the proposed project using molecular simulations. In order to utilize the existing knowledge about TCs at liquid-vapor interfaces, we will use a research strategy that will consider hypothetical systems that have properties common with liquid-vapor as well as solid-liquid interfaces. We expect that the knowledge gained from this project will be of technological relevance and contribute to the fundamental knowledge about solid-fluid interfaces."

<node TEXT="The temperature dependence of wetting phenomenon has been closely connected with the study of wetting  from the perspective of phase coexistence. Let us consider two states of a system: 1) a solid-vapor interface being partially wet by the liquid and 2) solid-vapor interface being completely wet. It is possible to study these states as two surface &quot;phases&quot;. Similar to coexistence between liquid and vapor these two surface phases can be in coexistence at certain system parametrers. The parameters of interest are temperature, or those related to the nature of the solid surface like the strength of interaction between solid and liquid, surface roughness etc. Analogous to wetting transitions, one may consider drying transitions where the role of liquid and vapor in the above two states are interchanged. The Figure \ref{figures/wet_dry_trans.eps} denotes the wetting and drying transitions." ID="ID_1917907773" CREATED="1457809458247" MODIFIED="1459697168137" NUMBERED="true"/>
<node TEXT="In1977 Cahn proposed that there exists a temperature below the critical temperature of fluid at which the wetting transition on a given solid surface occurs \cite{cahn1977critical}. The argument was based on the comparison between the temperature dependence of $\gamma_{\mathrm{sv}} - \gamma_{\mathrm{sl}}$  and $\gamma_{\mathrm{lv}}$. Cahn used a theoretical approach called as square-gradient version of Van der Waals theory and did not consider the atrraction between solid and liquid in explicit detail." ID="ID_1762818689" CREATED="1457983000888" MODIFIED="1459697825485" NUMBERED="true"/>
<node TEXT="Later, the square-gradient theory was modified by Nakanishi and Fisher to include the dependence of solid-fluid attraction \cite{nakanishi1982multicriticality}. They proposed a phase diagram which represented the coexistence lines for the wetting and drying transitions in the plot of temperature vs a parameter denoting the strength of solid-fluid interaction. Their phase diagram shows that for weak solid-liquid interaction, increase in temperature brings the system closer to drying transition. Whereas for strong solid-fluid interactions, increase in temperature brings the system closer to the wetting transition. It should be noted, however, that  these theories do not consider the molecular-level details of the solid surface or liquid. Therefore, the observations do not provide quantitative predictions of the wetting behavior in real systems. Secondly, the above studies only understand the behavior of systems &quot;at&quot; the wetting and drying transitions. From a technological perspective, it is also important to understand the temperature dependence of contact angles in the partial wetting regime."

<node TEXT="Another theoretical approach that is employed to understand the wetting behavior is the classical Density Functional theory (DFT). This theory considers molecular-level details of the system but is computationally less expensive as compared to molecular simulations. It considers the system in grand canonical ensemble and expresses the grand potential as a functional of the space-dependent density of the fluid. The equilibrium density of the fluid is calculated by minimizing the grand potential. The interfacial free energies like $\gamma_{\mathrm{sv}}$,  $\gamma_{\mathrm{sl}}$ and $\gamma_{\mathrm{lv}}$ are then obtained from the equilibrium density profile via the grand potential. Though this approach can be only used for very simple systems, it is able to provide qualitative understanding of the observations in real systems."

<node TEXT="One of the first applications of DFT to study wetting behavior is by Sullivan who employed the Van der Vaals theory without the square-gradient approximation \cite{sullivan1981surface}. Particularly, the Cahn&apos;s definition of solid surface was reinterpreted in terms of a more realistic solid-fluid interaction potential. This enabled Sullivan to study the variation of contact angle $\theta$ over a range of solid-fluid interaction strengths $\epsilo_{\mathrm{sw}}$ at multiple temperatures. It was observed that for small $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$ - where $\theta$ is large - $\theta$ increased with temperature. On the other hand, for large $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$ $\theta$ decreased with temperature. Similar influence of solid-fluid interactions on the temperature dependence of $\theta$ was also observed in more recent DFT studies. Kuiper and Blokhuis used DFT to reinterpret the square-gradient model of Nakanishi and Fisher described earlier in terms of the realistic solid-fluid interactions \cite{kuipers2009wetting}. In addition to verifying the phase diagram of wetting and drying transitions, they computed the contact angles for a wide range of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$. Here, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$ was characterized by the depth of square-well potential between solid and fluid. As in study of Sullivan, contact angles increased with temperature for small  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$ whereas opposite trend was observed for large  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$. Recently, Berim and Ruckenstein employed the canonical version of DFT to study the temperature dependence of contact angles over a range of substrate-fluid interaction strengths \cite{berim2011universality}. The system they studied was a liquid drop on a solid surface instead of a liquid film in contact with surface as studied by earlier mentioned works. The contact angle was also measured visually at the three phase contact line. Their solid surface was more realistic than the earlier studies and consisted of discrete molecules interacting with fluid molecules via Lennard Jones (LJ) potential. The LJ parameter for the solid-fluid interaction characterized $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$. Like earlier studies, they observed that $\theta$ increased with temperature for low $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$ whereas opposite trends were observed for large $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$. The notable distinction from the earlier studies was that the transition from the former regime to the later regime happened over a very narrow range of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$. Berim and Ruckenstein also commented on the significance and the potential applications of the intermediate substrate-strength at which the $\theta$ is almost independent of temperature. The above studies indicate that the temperature dependence of $\theta$ show some general trends with respect to the strength of attraction between surface and fluid. That being said, the complexity of systems that can be handled using DFT is limited. Especially, the heterogeneity of the solid surface that may play an important role in the wetting behavior was not considered."

<node TEXT="We finally note that the observed phase diagrams of wetting-drying transitions and the influence of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$ are related. The latter behavior may be roughly predicted from the phase coexistence curves in the T vs $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$ plane as shown in Figure \ref{figures/wet_dry_phasediagram.eps}. One may observe that as T increases, the range of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$ corresponding to the partial wetting regime narrows down and therefore the plots of $cos\theta$ vs $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$ becomes steaper as recently commented by Henderson \cite{henderson2011discussion}. However, it is not trivial to explain the very narrow range of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$ over which the inversion in T-dependence occurs. Another important point is that apart from the effect of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$, very few theoretical studies have attempted to understand the temperature dependence in terms of the role played by the molecular scale phenomena. Most of the arguments invoke the macroscopic physics of the system, say related to the surface phase coexistence. Though it is just a matter of interpretation, explaining the observations in terms of molecular scle phenomena can aid in the technological application of various observations."

<node TEXT="Wetting of liquids on solid surfaces is a vast field with numerous applications. In recent years, many experimental studies have documented wetting properties on natural and artificial surfaces. This trend is fuelled by the improved ability to manipulate microscopic and nanoscopic details of the surfaces and the measuring devices. One of the most important sub-field of the wetting research is the investigation of solid surfaces that have superhydrophobic properties. In most studies, the equilibrium property that is measured is the contact angle ($\theta$) that a small liquid drop makes with the solid surface. In others, instead of liquid drop the force of adhesion between liquid and a solid surface is measured, or the time required for absorption of a liquid in a column packed with the desired solid material is determined. The later two methods then use theoretical models to relate the measured quantities to $\theta$. Most of these studies use $\theta$ to characterize the hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of the solid surfaces. Generally, the main goal of such studies is to design a solid surface by manipulating a single feature of solid surface, either roughness \cite{ramiasa2016tuning} or solid-fluid interaction \cite{wang1999studies}. Relatively fewer studies have been performed to understand the wetting behavior where combinations of two or more surface features are considered \cite{liu2014bio}. Coming to the temperature dependence, the available experimental data is even rare. The most prominent set of data is by Neumann and colleagues \cite{neumann1970temperature,neumann1974advances,budziak1991temperature}, who studied the temperature dependence of contact angles on different polymer surfaces. It was observed that the contact angles may increase or decrease with the nature of the solid surface, especially the strength of interaction between solid and fluid. These results approximately comply with the theoritical predictions \cite{sullivan1981surface,nakanishi1982multicriticality,berim2011universality}. However, it should be noted that the systems used in these experiments are more complex than those generally used in theoretical investigations. The complex nature of the solid surface meant that many factors related to the surface may have contributed to the observed temperature dependence. For example, in addition to changes on the liquid side of the solid-liquid interface, polymer surfaces may have been significantly influenced by change in temperature.  Recently, there have been studies concerned with the development of solid surfaces which can switch from hydrophilic to hydrophobic behavior with increase in temperature \cite{balamurugan2003thermal,de2014reversible,li2014thermo}. These surfaces are made by grafting certain polymers on a solid base. The grafted polymers undergo transition from the extended state to the collapsed state on increasing temperature, which changes their interaction with the liquid molecules, therby resulting in the change of wetting behavior. Thus, the observed thermal response of wetting is actually the manifestation of the phase behavior of polymers in a particular liquid. In the proposed project we plan to first decopule the thermally induced changes occuring in the solid surface from those in the liquid. We will only study solid surfaces whose structure is negligibly influenced by the changes in temperature or by the liquid. Therefore, we do not consider solid surfaces grafted with thermal responsive polymers." ID="ID_220869422" CREATED="1458571496785" MODIFIED="1459711080976" MOVED="1458571505107" NUMBERED="true"/>
<node TEXT="Apart from measurement of contact angles, the wetting behavior on solid surfaces have also been studied by looking at the growth of a thin liquid film on the surface of interest under controlled conditions. This approach is more in line with the theoretical studies concerned with wetting and drying transistions \cite{bonn2001wetting}. Typically, the eqilibrium thickness of a liquid film on a surface indicates whether the system is in complete drying ($\theta = \pi$), partial wetting or complete wetting ($\theta = 0$) regime. The transitions between each of these regimes can be considered as surface phase transitions akin to those between bulk phases, say liquid and vapor. It is then possible to represent these regimes in a surface phase diagrams in the plane of temperature vs some order parameter characterizing the surface feature of interest. This order parameter may be related to attraction between surface and fluid molecules $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$ or roughness   Several such studies have been performed with goal of studying the fundamental aspects of wetting transitions \cite{bonn2001wetting}. Most of these studies consider the temperature temperature dependence because it is the system variable that is used to study the transition. However, due to the technical challenges involved in performing such studies, the solid surfaces they investigate are relatively less complex than those employed in the experiments measuring contact angles. As a result, to our knowledge, no systematic data is available as a function of either $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$ or roughness. Unlike wetting transitions, drying transitions have not been studied using experiments. Such studies can be useful in understanding the thermal response of wetting on solid surfaces where contact angles are large. That being said, in the proposed project we do not plan to experimentally study the wetting and drying transitions using the above approach. This is because at this stage, there are several technical challenges in employing these methods to study the solid-fluid systems that we wish to consider. Moreover, it is impractical to employ such techniques to study wetting on many different types of solid surfaces. Finally, we note that unlike solid surfaces, the technical challenges in using the &quot;growth of liquid film&quot; approach  to study wetting on liquid-vapor or liquid-liquid interfaces are less severe. However, such systems are outside the scope of the current project." ID="ID_566286120" CREATED="1457810509708" MODIFIED="1459711557887" MOVED="1457810517632" NUMBERED="true"/>

<node TEXT="Here we focus our discussion on the Molecular Dynamics (MD) or Monte Carlo (MC) simulation studies performed to study equilibrium wetting behavior of liquids on solid surfaces. The number of such studies have grown in previous few years to predict the wetting behavior on novel surfaces that can be manipulated at increasingly smaller scales. The trend has also been fuelled by the discovery of new applications for the novel substances like room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) and graphene. The molecular simulations provide two main advantages: 1) They can be used to estimate the wetting behavior in systems that are still to be developed and therefore, guide the rational design of surfaces. This is important because as the scale of features on a surface decreases, the conventional theories that are mostly based on continuum approximation fail.  2) They can be used to understand the molecular-level aspects of the wetting behavior that is observed in experiments. The important challenges in any molecular simulation study are as follows: 1) Upper limit on the system size due to steep increase in the required computational resources. Therefore, as will be done in the proposed study, they are only limited to the systems with sizes less than few nanometers. 2) The results depend on the models of molecules. Ideally, it is expected that the models are parameterized to reproduce the experimental properties. However, if prediction of properties is the objective, such parameterization is not possible. In the current study we do not focus on the the quantitative prediction of properties for real systems. Also, we do not aim to rigorously understand the molecular level phenomena of real systems that are used in experiments. Our objective is to gather the general trends in the macroscopic properties by varying certain features of the solid surface. This allows us to use simple models for molecules of liquids and solids and work at conditions that enable effeicient calculation of desired properties."

<node TEXT="There are two important ways of computing the wetting properties like interfacial free energies and contact angles from molecular simulations. One approach is by actually simulating a nanodroplet of a liquid on a solid surface. This strategy is generally employed via MD simulations. This is analogous to the sessile drop method in experiments.  The contact angle is then determined from the angle that the liquid-vapor interface makes with the solid surface at the three phase contact line. One important difference from the experiments is that the interfaces can be more precisely defined based on the local fluid densities. The solid-liquid ($\gamma_{\mathrm{sl}}$)  and solid-vapor ($\gamma_{\mathrm{sv}}$) interfacial free energies are then calculated using the Young&apos;s equation. The main limitations of this approach are: 1) Large systems are necessary to account for the effect of line tensions \cite{indekeu1993line} on the observed values of the contact angle, and 2) Discrepancies may be observed at high temperatures if the droplet is not in equilibrium with the surrounding vapor. This method was recently employed to determine the contact angles of a monoatomic liquid on solid surfaces at different temperatures. \cite{becker2014contact,horsch2010contact}. In these studies, the authors studied surfaces having different parameters for the solid-fluid interaction strengths $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$. They investigated the temperature dependence of all the three wetting regimes: complete drying, partial wetting and complete wetting. They observed that the contact angle $\theta$  increase with temperature for small $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$ and decreases with temperature for large $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$. Importantly, they observed that the inversion of temperature dependence happens sharply at $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}^o$ where $\theta = \mathrm{90^o}$ and the behavior is symmetric about $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}^o$. This observation was explained by referiing to the linear dependence of solid-fluid interfacial free energies on fluid densities and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$. The opposite trends with temperature for weak and strong surfaces are expected from theory, as both wetting and drying transitions are favored at high temperatures. However, from a statistical-mechanical perspective, one neither expects the inversion to occur at a single value of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}^o$ nor that it should correspond to the $\theta = \mathrm{90^o}$."

<node TEXT="The second way of applying molecular simulations is by using an open system (grand canonical ensemble) where the number of fluid molecules is variable. Such a simulated system is compliant with the statistical-mechanics-based theories on wetting because at microscopic scales, the interface exchanges fluid molecules with the surroundings. Moreover, it helps in maintaining liquid-vapor coexistence conditions that are necessary to study equlibrium wetting phenomenon. Instead of simulating a nanodroplet, one tracks the variation of free energy as a liquid film is grown on a solid surface after starting from the saturated vapor phase \cite{grzelak2008computation}. The properties like $\gamma_{\mathrm{lv}}$ and $\gamma_{\mathrm{sv}} - \gamma_{\mathrm{sl}}$ can then be computed from the above profile. Contact angles are then computed by using the Young&apos;s equation. This method is generally applied via MC simulations and is compatible with various &quot;Alchemical&quot; techniques \cite{kumar2011monte}. These methods have been previously employed to study the wetting behavior in different solid-fluid systems at different temperatures \cite{rane2011monte,kumar2011monte,rane2014understanding}. The calculations were performed over a wide range of solid-fluid interaction strengths $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$. Similar to the studies described in the previous paragraph, it was observed that for small $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$ contact angles increase with temperature whereas opposite trend exists for large $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$. However, the inversion of temperature dependence was not sharp, but occurred over a narrow range of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$. This range also depended on the chemical nature of the fluid and the solid surface, and in most cases, corresponded to $\theta$ diiferent from $90^o$. These obervations are in agreement with the theoretical predictions based on the density functional theory \cite{sullivan1981surface}."

<node TEXT="Though the wetting of liquids on solid surfaces is a vast field, few studies have focused on the temperature dependence of wetting behavior \cite{neumann1970temperature,neumann1974advances,budziak1991temperature,sullivan1981surface,nakanishi1982multicriticality,berim2011universality,becker2014contact,horsch2010contact,rane2014understanding}. &#xa;Most of the above studies did not explicitly consider the heterogeneous surfaces or the effect of TCs. The thermal response of wetting may be influenced by the TCs at liquid-vapor as well as solid-liquid interfaces. The thermal capillary waves (CWs) that involve the undulations of the liquid-vapor interface in the direction perpendicular to the macroscopic interface result in long-ranged TCs. Let us say that our system is three-dimensional with the liquid-vapor interface in x-y plane, then the interface for a particular confguration of molecules can be defined as $z = \xi (x,y)$. Let $z = \mathrm{0}$ represent the averaged l-v interface . The undulations of this surface is then analyzed by performing the spectral analysis of $\xi$ as follows: Here, $\boldsymbol{r}$ is the vector  in the x-y plane and $\lambda$ denotes the wavelength of the undulations. The capillary wave theory, defines the CWs as the undulations of very large wavelength, that is $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$. The macroscopic surface tension  $\sigma$ can be expressed in terms of the contribution from the CWs ($\sigma_{\mathrm{c}}$) and that from other aspects of the interface ($\sigma_{\mathrm{b}}$) \cite{kayser1986effect}. One can further identify the contributions to $\sigma_{\mathrm{c}}$ from CWs above a particular wavelenght $\lambda$ and define the wavelength dependent surface tension $\sigma_{\lambda}$."

He observed that near the triple point, when $\lambda$ is about 10 times the molecular diameter, $\sigma_{\lambda}$ is about 15% higher than the macroscopic value. Near the critical point, the similar increase of 15% is obtained if $\lambda$ is 20 times the molecular diameter. The contributions from undulations of larger wavelength were also found to be important in different experimental studies \cite{fradin2000reduction}. Here, $\sigma_{\lambda}$ was calculated using the scattering intensity measured from the X-ray diffraction study of the l-v interface. A more thorough analysis of the temperature dependence of $\sigma_{\lambda}$ was recently performed by Hoefling and Dietrich using molecular simulations \cite{hofling2015enhanced}. They observed that the ratio $\frac{\sigma_{\lambda}}{\sigma} varies significantly with temperature. There observations have also been supported by the theoretical study performed by Parry, Rascon and Evans \cite{parry2015local}."

Therefore, the above studies \cite{kayser1986effect,hofling2015enhanced,parry2015local} imply that surface tension of such a pinned interface shows a different temperature dependence than that of the unpinned or free interface. Such a pinned interface is present near the interface between liquid and certain rough solid surfaces. For example, several designs of superhydrophobic or superoleophobic surfaces have protruding stuctures having dimensions between micrometers and nanometers. When liquid sits at the top of these pillars (Cassie-Baxter regime \cite{cassie1944wettability}) a bounded liquid-vapor interface exists between the pillars as shown in the Figure \ref{replvcassie}. Note that the macroscopic solid-liquid interface consists of several such bounded liquid-vapor interfaces. The theoretical predictions about the temperature dependence of $\sigma_{\lambda}$ can be useful in tuning the thermal response of the wetting behavior by manipulating the distance between these pillars and their arrangement in two dimensions."

<node TEXT="The above analysis based on CWs cannot be used for solid surfaces that do not manifest the Cassie-Baxter-like regime. In such cases, the range of TCs near solid surface increases with decrease in the density of the liquid near solid-liquid interface. This was recently shown for water molecules near hydrophobic surfaces using molecular simulations \cite{evans2015quantifying}. In this work Wilding and Evans used a quantity called local compressibility $\chi$ as a function of the distance $z$ from the solid surface. The large magnitude of $\chi(z)$ indicates the presence of long-ranged TCs. They observed a distinct peak near surfaces, even for those with contact angles as small as $\mathrm{26^{o}}$. These results show that TCs can contribute to the solid-liquid interfacial free energies, and their temperature dependence, even in absence of the Cassie-Baxter regime."

Jensen et al. \cite{jensen2003water} observed the depletion of water near hydrophobic surface with Xray reflectiveity studies. Jensen et al. also estimated the thickness of the region near the interface over which the depletion occurs. Particularly, they observed that the depletion-layer thickness can increase by 10-30% when temperatures are increased over a range of $\mathrm{30^{o}C}$. Similar observations were made using the neutron reflectivity measurements conducted by Maccarinit et. al \cite{maccarini2007density}.

Over the years, they have studied the influence of surface roughness \cite{metya2014wetting} and the chemical nature of surface \cite{dutta2011wetting} on the equilibrium wetting behavior. Most studies have employed the nanodroplet approach mentioned earlier and MD simulations to calculate contact angles for realistic models of liquids and surfaces. Some of their studies have also looked at the fundamental aspects of wetting transitions by tracking the growth of a liquid film via MC simulations \cite{khan2011surface}. Recently, they and the collaborators looked at the thermal response of wetting behavior of water on a solid surface grafted with thermo-responsive polymer \cite{bhandary2016molecular}. As noted earlier, such phenomena are due to the combined effects of rearrangement of surface molecules and the change in surface-fluid interactions. The work proposed in this document will be complementary to those studies because we will study only the effect of solid-fluid interaction usng surfaces whose molecules do not rearrange with temperature. Regarding the temperature dependence, Jayant Singh and collaborators have also studied the relation between wetting of water on nano-patterned surfaces and the nucleation of ice \cite{singh2014characterization}.

At CSIR National Aerospace Laboratories, Harish Barshilia and co-workers are involved in fabrication and characterization of nano-patterned surfaces for different applications. Though most of these surfaces are developed with the the goal of improving the photocatalysis \cite{barshilia2012nanometric}, they have also reported the wetting properties of some of them \cite{barshilia2014superhydrophobic,selvakumar2013vapor}. An important part of their work is to study the thermal and mechanical stability of the resulting surfaces or coatings \cite{Chaliyawala201695}.

<node TEXT="The understanding of wetting phenomenon has greatly benefitted from the theoretical studies on phase equilibria. We expect that the knowledge of phase behavior will play an important part in designing solid surfaces with desired thermal response. In 1983 Dr. Rahul Pandit (now at IISc Bengaluru) and Dr. Michael Fisher predicted different wetting scenarios near the triple point of a fluid \cite{pandit1983wetting}. Their analysis demonstrated that the temperature dependence of different interfacial free energies can result in rich wetting behavior near the triple point. More recently, Dr. Sanjay Puri (JNU Delhi), Dr. Subir Das (JNCASR Bengaluru) and their collaborators studied the interplay between the liquid-liquid phase transition in a region bounded by solid surfaces and the wetting of individual phases on the surfaces \cite{das2006spinodal,binder2010phase}. Particularly, they studied the non-equilibrium effects of varying the temperature of the system. Dr. Sanjay Puri and collaborators have also investigated the above systems in the presence of temperature gradients \cite{jaiswal2013phase}.  The work of the above mentioned researchers is relevant to the proposed project in two ways: 1) They demonstrate the usefulness of simple models and computationally less expensive methods of studying solid-fluid interfaces, and 2) they show the importance of transverse correlations (TCs) by tracking a quantity analogous to the density-density correlation function to study phase separation along the plane of the surface. Finally, the non-equilibrium phenomena and non-uniform temperature distribution that is considered in these works is relevant to our future studies on more realistic systems."

<node TEXT="The survey of the research field indicates that the measurements or calculations concerned with the thermal response of wetting behavior are very scarce. The available measurements involve solid-fluid systems that are complex in the sense that multiple factors influence their thermal response. In order to rationally design the surfaces, it is first necessary to approximately isolate the different factors and study their roles individually. The first factor that we plan to isolate is the effect of temperature on the arrangement of molecules of the solid. We will only consider the solids whose structure is negligibly affected in the desired temperature range. This will ensure that the thermal response of wetting only depends on the arrangement of fluid molecules near the surface and the nature of solid-fluid interaction. We then divide the features of the surface into three categories: 1) Average solid-fluid interaction strength, 2) surface roughness and 3) chemical heterogeneity of the surface. We will systematically investigate each of these features using experiments and molecular simulations. Molecular simulations will be used for surfaces with nanoscopic or atomic-scale features, whereas experiments will be used to study features at larger scales. The focus will on the determination of equilibrium solid-fluid interfacial properties and their variation with temperature. The collected data will be analyzed to identify trends with respect to different variables related to the solid surface."

Such a strategy provides us the flexibility in selecting the solid and fluid models to be used in simulations. In the proposed project we will use simple models that enable us to investigate a variety of solid surfaces in a computationally efficient manner. Though these models will be less realistic, they will help provide fundamental insights into the molecular-scale phenomena associated with the temperature-dependent wetting behavior. For example, in real systems, both the electrostatic as well as non-electrostatic interactions between molecules may influence the interfacial phenomena. The individual effect of these interactions can be studied by simulating models of molecules that interact with different proportion of the above types of interactions \cite{rane2014understanding}. One novelty of our project will be the manner in which the experimental and the computational results will be analyzed. We will combine the &quot;trends&quot; that are obtained from the two sets of results. This will help us to understand the dependence of wetting behavior and its thermal response on the characteristics of a particular surface feature at different scales.

In order to mimic the effect of the surface, many of these studies have used an external field that is constant along the plane of the interface. Considering the inhomogeneity of the real solid-fluid interfaces, it will be useful to systematically study the effect of the fields that vary along the plane of the interface. Secondly, it is well known that TCs at liquid-vapor interfaces are long-ranged and easily characterized using computational techniques. Therefore, we expect to obtain greater insights by using a research strategy of first studying systems that are similar to liquid-vapor interfaces, and then gradually moving towards solid-fluid interfaces. Such an approach will be also aided by the experience of the author in studying TCs at liquid-vapor interface \cite{rane2016understanding,rane2016using} and computing macroscopic properties at solid-liquid interfaces \cite{rane2011monte,rane2014understanding}."

For example, if A is surface roughness then molecular simulations will be used to study the effect on roughness at scales smaller than few nanometers whereas experiments will be used for larger scales. The data as represented in the Figure \ref{repdgvsg} can help us to systematically study the trends with respect to each surface feature. Each of the &quot;features&quot; that we mentioned above are broad categories that can be manipulated by changing different surface characteristics. For example, a rough surface contains  different surface features like hills and valleys (Figure \ref{repsurffeaturesrough}). The roughness feature can then be manipulated by changing the depth of the valleys or by changing the spacing between hills. The points obtained by changing the former characteristic may lie on a curve that is different from the one obtained by changing the later. This is represented in Figure \ref{repdgvsg} where the curves $l_{\mathrm{1}} and $l_{\mathrm{2}}$ represent the trends obtained by manipulating the feature A in two different ways. We are interested in identifying such trends from the collected data. Though the main goal of this project is to understand the effect of solid surface, we plan to obtain results with few fluids to undderstand the variation with fluid nature. Typically, these fluids will differ in the proportion of electrostatic and dispersion interactions between theire molecules or ions. For example, experiments will be performed using fluids like hexadecane (lacking electrostatic interactions), water (both electrostatic and nonelectrostatic) and room temperature ionic liquids (electrostatic interactions are dominating). Coming to the molecular simulations, we will use fluid models with different proportion of electrostatic and dispersion interactions. These models will mostly contain monoatomic particles interacting with electrostatic and non-electrostatic interactions, the parameters of which will vary for different fluids. The choice of such a simple model of fluid has two advantages: 1) Only the desired type of fluid-fluid interaction is considered, excluding the effects of the shape of the molecule, and 2) the computation of properties is less expensive.  In the following paragraphs we describe the main surface features that we will investigate."

<node TEXT="\loadfig{2} Roughness of the solid surface. The solid surface can be rough at multiple scales. At the lowest scale, the arrangement of molecules on the face of the crystal is also a form of roughness. In order to study its effect, the studies performed in the previous paragraph will employ solid crystals with different orientation of surface atoms ( say 100, 110 or 001 crystal faces). The effect of large scale roughness will be experimentally studied using TiO2, ZnO and SiO2 surfaces. The roughness will be modulated using plasma \cite{barshilia2014superhydrophobic} or chemical itching \cite{tuteja2008robust}. The duration of the itching process and the conditions employed will enable us to control the roughness. Though most of the above surfaces will lack regular geometric features, we plan to study few silical substrates with regular microscopic patterns as shown in Figure \ref{rep_surffeaturesrough}. The use of materials like TiO2 and ZnO will also enable us to vary the interaction between the surface atoms and those of the liquid (see previous section). The scale of features that we expect to study in experimental systems will range from 100nm to few micrometers. We will use molecular simulations at the lower scales, where the solid will be crystalline and made of monoatomic molecules. If the solid surface lies in x-y plane, then the surface patterns can be broadly characterized into two types as shown in Figure \ref{repsurffeaturesrough}: 1) Those that vary along only one axis (stripped pattern) and 2) Those that vary along both x and y axes (chessboard pattern).  We stress that in molecular simulations, the features are always periodic at the macroscopic scale. The shape of these patterns will be rectangular. The studies will be performed for different characteristic dimensions of the above two types of patterns. For example, the rectangular features with different spacings between the columns and different depths of the asperities will be investigated.  As in the previous section, we will also see the effect of varying solid-fluid interaction strengths using advanced simulation techniques."

<node TEXT="\loadfig{3} Chemically heterogeous solid surfaces. We first discuss the surfaces for experimental studies. At the atomistic level, chemical heterogeneity is synonimous with the structure of individual molecules forming the surface and their arrangement in crystal. Hence, the measurements to be performed for different crystal faces of TiO2 (see previous paragraph) will also include the effect of chemical heterogeneity. It is also possible to achieve chemical heterogeneity at similar or slightly larger scales by using surfaces made of block co-polymers or by chemical functionalization. However, we expect that the properties of such solid surfaces will be significantly affected by temperature. Therefore, we will not investigate such heterogeneity in the current project. For scales ranging from 100nm to few micrometers, we will use TiO2 and ZnO surfaces that are made heterogeneous by selective exposure to radiation. Studies will be performed with two types of patterns : 1) Stripped and 2) Chess board (Figure \ref{repsurffeatureschem}). For each type, we will also consider different dimensions of the features.  We will use molecular simulations to cover the features ranging from atomic scale to few nanometers. The solid surface will be crystalline and made of monoatomic molecules. In order to study the atomic scale heterogeneity, we will use different interaction parameters for atoms  in the liquid-facing part of the unit cell (Figure \ref{repsurffeatureschem}.

Most of the studies will be conducted by using Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm via a free-energy based approach. In this approach we compute the interfacial free energies like $\gamma_{\mathrm{sv}} - \gamma_{\mathrm{sl}}$ and $\gamma_{\mathrm{lv}}$ by using the probability distributions that are collected from the  simulations. These distributions are collected as a function of suitable order parameter like number of fluid molecules or solid-fluid interaction strength $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$. The system that is simulated is shown in the snapshots accompanying the Figure \ref{repintpotential}. The simulation cell is parallelopiped and is bounded by the solid surface of interest on the lower side and a control wall on the upper side. The nature of the control-wall is described below. The simulation is performed such that  cell is periodic in the x and y directions along the plane of the solid surface. Note that the positions of the molecules of the surface are fixed during the simulation because we will only study the &quot;rigid&quot; surfaces.  We will work in the grand canonical (GC) ensemble where we fix the temperature T, volume of the cell V and the chemical potential of the fluid $\mu_{\mathrm{sat}}$ that corresponds to the liquid-vapor coexistence conditions. When the number of molecules is less, the configuration corresponds to the vapor in contact with the surface. Large number corresponds to a liquid slab attached to one of the two surfaces.

<node TEXT="\loadfig{4} Direct simulations \cite{rane2011monte}. Here the main order parameter is the number of molecules of the fluid. These may be further divided into two types depending on the nature of the control wall. The control wall is an external field that acts over a very small range and is not atomistically detailed.  Typically, its influence extends to only few molecular diameters away from it. If the interaction strength of this wall with the fluid $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{cw}}$ is much greater than that of the solid surface ($\varepsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$), then we refer to such simulations as drying simulations. On the other hand if $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{cw}} &lt;&lt; \varepsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$, then the simulations are called spreading simulations. In the former case, the liquid slab &quot;grows&quot; on the control wall and in the later case, it grows on the solid surface of interest. The probability distribution collected from this simulations is used to compute the interface potential $V$ as shown in the Figure \ref{repintpotential}. The different parts of the profile are proportioanal to interfacial free energies. For spreading simulation: \loadeq{1} \loadeq{2} Here, $A$ is the cross-setional area of the simulation cell and $C_{\mathrm{spread}}$ is a constant depending on the cell geometry.  For drying simulations: \loadeq{3} \loadeq{4} Both these simulations are performed for a a particular surface and $\gamma_{\mathrm{sv}} - \gamma_{\mathrm{sl}}$ and $\gamma_{\mathrm{lv}}$ are obtained by the solving the above system of equations. Once $\gamma_{\mathrm{lv}}$ at a particular temperature is known, one can then proceed with only one of the abovementioned simulations to calculate solid-fluid interfacial properties for other surfaces. Spreading simulations are preferred for solid surfaces with stronger attraction towards fluid molecules, whereas drying simulations are used for weaker surfaces.

<node TEXT="Expanded ensemble simulations \cite{rane2011monte}. In the plots from direct simulations, one may notice that the regions of interest are the valleys and plateaus. Therefore, if one has the direct simulation results for a particular surface, then one only needs to track the position of the valley and the plateau with a desired surface characteristic. This is acheived using the expanded ensemble (EE) simulations. First, an order parameter, say $x$, is defined which characterizes the surface feature to be studied. This can be $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}$ or a parameter related to the roughness or the chemical heterogeneity of the surface. One then performs EE simulations where, along with the number of molecules $N$, even x is allowed to change and the probability distribution of $x$ is used to calculate the relative free energies. Unlike the direct simulations, $N$ is allowed to vary in a small region, like the valley or a small part of the plateau in the Figure \ref{repintpotential}. The process is depicted by dashed lines in the Figure \ref{repintpotential}. There are four different types of simulations that can be performed. As in the direct simulations, $V_{\mathrm{valley}}^{S}$ and $V_{\mathrm{plateau}}^{S}$ are tracked for stronger surfaces, whereas the drying counterparts are tracked for weaker surfaces. This strategy enables one to scan a large parameter space with less computational expense. Another important advantage comes from the fact that the interfacial free energies are calculated at the closely space values of the desired order parameter. This is useful to numerically compute the quantities like $\frac{\mathrm{d}(\gamma_{\mathrm{sv}} - \gamma_{\mathrm{sl}})}{\mathrm{d}\epsilon_{\mathrm{sw}}) which can provide important information about the nature of the wetting or drying transition."

<node TEXT="The calculation of $\frac{\mathrm{d}(\gamma_{\mathrm{sv}} - \gamma_{\mathrm{sl}})}{\mathrm{d}T}$. One straightforward way of calculating this quantity is to perform the direct and expanded ensemble (EE) simulations at two adjacent temperatures. In addition to being computationally expensive, this strategy suffers from the challenge of selecting suitable adjacent temperature. If the adjacent temperature is too close, then the precision of the above quantity will be poor. On the other hand if it is too far, the numerical derivative will not be accurate. Another alternative is to use EE simulations with order parameter as temperature. However, such simulations can only be performed for a particular solid surface, and will not be practical for the current project because of the variety of surfaces that we wish to investigate. In the proposed project we will employ the Gibbs-formalism-based approach to extract the temperature-derivatives of interfacial free energies from a simulation data performed at single temperature. Following from interfacial equivalent of Gibbs-Duhem equation, one can write: \loadeq{5} Here, $s_{\mathrm{sv}} (s_{\mathrm{sl}})$ is the solid-vapor (solid-liquid) excess entropy per unit area of the interface and $\Gamma_{\mathrm{sv}} (\Gamma_{\mathrm{sl}})$ are the excess number of molecules per unit area at the solid-vapor (solid-liquid) interface. Any excess quantity $X_{\mathrm{sf}}$ for the interface between solid and a fluid (liquid or vapor) is given as follows: \loadeq{6} Here, $X_{\mathrm{total}}$ is the quantity corresponding to the total system and $X_{\mathrm{f}}$ is the quantity of fluid in absence of the interface. Among the quantities in the RHS of Equation (\ref{eqn5}), $\Gamma_{\mathrm{sv}} - \Gamma_{\mathrm{sl}}$ can be calculated from the probability distributions of the number of molecules in the EE simulations. In order to compute $\frac{\mathrm{d}\mu_{\mathrm{sat}}}{\mathrm{d}T}$, we use a form of Clausius-Clapeyron equation \cite{frenkel2001understanding}: \loadeq{7} Here $\rho_{\mathrm{sat}}^{\mathrm{f}}$ denotes the number of molecules of the bulk fluid $\mathrm{f}  = \mathrm{l} (liquid) or \mathrm{v} (vapor)$ in a unit volume, under the liquid-vapor saturation conditions. $u_{\mathrm{sat}}^{\mathrm{f}}$ denotes the bulk energy density for a fluid under liquid-vapor saturation conditions. The excess entropies can be computed from the molecular simulations via the following expression: \loadeq{8} Here $e_{\mathrm{sf}}$ denotes the excess energy of the solid-fluid interface ($\mathrm{f = l}$ for liquid or $v$ for vapor). It is obtained using the ensemble average of interaction energy between the molecules of fluid and that between fluid and solid surface. This approach enables us to compute $\frac{\mathrm{d}(\gamma_{\mathrm{sv}} - \gamma_{\mathrm{sl}})}{\mathrm{d}T}$ over a wide variety of solid surfaces. Finally, we note that $\frac{\mathr{d}\gamma_{\mathrm{lv}}}{\mathrm{d}T}$ can also be obtained from our simulations using the similar strategy. The calculation of temperature derivative of cosine of contact angle $\mathrm{cos}\theta$ can be then be straightforwardly acheived via the Young&apos;s equation. as follows: \loadeq{9}" ID="ID_1612573911" CREATED="1459358961768" MODIFIED="1460971630564" NUMBERED="true">

The important criteria for selecting model systems are 1) the computational feasibility of simulations, 2) similarity to the real solid-fluid systems that we plan to design in future and 3) the potential of obtaining fundamental insights into the phenomena at the interface. We think that these criteria are satisfied by the model of solid and fluid made of spherical particles interacting with the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential. The parameters of the LJ potential can be tuned to mimic a broad range of interactions betwen molecules. This potential has been extensively employed in molecular simulations to study bulk as well as interfacial phenomena \cite{rane2011monte}. The systems will be broadly classified based on their deviation from the liquid-vapor interface as represented in the Figure \ref{repTCsystems}. We plan to look at three to four such categories with different surface-densities of the solid particles. Note that the positions of solid particles will be fixed and insensitive to temperature because we are interested in the TCs on the liquid side of the solid-liquid interface. In each of the above categories, we will investigate the role of chemical nature of the solid particles and their arrangement (Figure \ref{repTCsystems}).

<node TEXT="The objective behind modifying the chemical nature of the solid particles is to study the variation of TCs and the thermal response of interfacial free energies with solid-fluid interaction.

The former will  mimic the effect of uniformly modifying the solid surface by a suitable treatment. The latter will mimic the solid surfaces that are chemically heterogeneous like graphene sheets doped with boron and nitrogen \cite{ci2010atomic} or crystalline surfaces of titanium dioxide \cite{wang1999studies}. The interfaces with large spacings between solid particles are approximations of the surfaces with nanoscopic pillars (Figure \ref{replvcassie}).

<node TEXT="All molecular simulations will be performed with the Metropolis Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm \cite{metropolis1953equation}. The MC simulations allow us to work in the grand canonical (GC) ensemble where the number of fluid molecules in the simulated system can change. The GC ensemble is suited for studying interfacial phenomena at liquid-vapor coexistence conditions. The application of the GC simulations to the above systems is depicted in the Figure \ref{repGCsetup}. We will also employ expanded ensemble techniques that  enable the manipulation of surface features during the course of a simulation. Such a strategy is computationally efficient for calculating the properties for multiple surface features in a single simulation. The important property that will be obtained from simulations is the interface potential $V(N;\boldsymbol{\Lambda})$, where $N$ denotes the number of molecules of the fluid and $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ denotes the vector of parameters associated with the solid particles. For example $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ may be related to the LJ parameters of different solid particles or to their arrangement. We will compute $V(N;\boldsymbol{\Lambda})$ using the Transition Matrix Monte Carlo (TMMC) scheme \cite{swendsen1999transition}. From the methodological perspective, the project will provide an opportunity for employing TMMC to compute $V$ as a function of multiple independent variables.

<node TEXT="The first quantity that will be used to characterize TCs is the local compressibility of the fluid $\chi(\boldsymbol{r})$ at a position $\boldsymbol{r}$ near the interface \cite{evans2015local}. It is related to the density-density correlations in the fluid by the following integral: Here, $G(\boldsymbol{r},\boldsymbol{r&apos;})$ denotes the correlation between the fluctuation in local densities at $\boldsymbol{r}$ and $\boldsymbol{r&apos;}$.In order to calculate this quantity, we will use the alternative definition: Here, $\rho(\boldsymbol{r})$ denotes the local density of the fluid, $\mu$ is the chemical potential of the fluid, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the temperature. We will use histogram-reweighting techniques to calculate the right hand side from GC simulations \cite{rane2016understanding}. Coming to the analysis, it is known that TCs result in large magnitude of $\chi(\boldsymbol{r})$ near liquid-vapor \cite{stecki1996susceptibilities} and solid-liquid \cite{evans2015quantifying} interfaces. We will calculate $\chi$ at different locations $\boldsymbol{r}$ in the selected systems and use this data to compare the significance of TCs for different arrangements and chemical natures of the solid particles. This is explained with an example in Figure \ref{chiLJ}. Here, we compare $\chi$ at different distances from the liquid-vapor interface of a LJ fluid. We observe that the height of the peak in $\chi(z)$ decreases with the strength of the applied field. This indicates that the applied field suppresses TCs at the liquid-vapor interface. One unique feature of the proposed project will be the calculation of $\chi(r)$ in three dimensional space ($\boldsymbol{r} \equiv [x,y,z]$). This is necessary because our interfaces will be heterogeneous in all the three dimensions. To the author&apos;s knowledge, all the previous studies have calculated $\chi$ as a function of the distance from the interface.

<node TEXT="The TCs will be also studied in terms of the undulations of the local interface in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the macroscopic interface (Figure \ref{repTCIS}). We will define the interface by an instantaneous surface (IS) of constant fluid density \cite{willard2010instantaneous} and track height $h(\boldsymbol{R})$ during the simulations. Here, $\boldsymbol{R}$ denotes the coordinates in the plane of the macroscopic interface. For example, if the macroscopic interface extends along the X and Y axes, $\boldsymbol{R} \equiv [x,y]$. TCs are characterized by the correlations between heights at two or more positions along the plane of the interface. In other words, TCs can be considered as waves on the IS. Therefore, the Fourier transform $\bar{h}(\lambda)$ will be useful in understanding the contribution from TCs of a particular wavelength $\lambda$. As explanined earlier, the distance between the solid particles fixed at the interface may have significant influence on the TCs of a partcular $\lambda$. We therefore  expect to gather important insights about the effect of arrangement of solid particles on the TCs by calculating $\bar{h}(\lambda)$. The Fourier transform $\bar{h}(\lambda)$ also helps in quantifying the contribution of TCs of particular wavelength to the macroscopic properties like interfacial free energies \cite{mecke1999effective}.

<node TEXT="The macroscopic quantities like interfacial free energies and their components will be calculated from the interface potential $V(N; \boldsymbol{\Lambda})$ that was mentioned earlier. It is related to the Helmholtz free energy $F$ and chemical potential $\mu$ by the following equation: We will obtain this from GC simulations via TMMC approach. The choice of the vector $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ will depend on the system under consideration. For example, in case of a single solid particle fixed at the interface, $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ will contain two components: 1) one related to the LJ energy parameter that determines the interaction between the solid particle and fluid molecules and 2) another related to the LJ size parameter that determines the size of the solid particle. For greater number of particles $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ will also contain parameters related to the distance and the relative orientation of solid particles (Figure \ref{repTCsystems}). In the rest of the discussion we do not specify $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ in arguments for notational simplicity. We explain the significance of $V(N) using Figure \ref{repVNLJ} which shows profiles for a single fixed particle and FCC crystal with 100 plane facing the liquid.

The approximate distance between the liquid-vapor interface and the solid is denoted on the upper axis. The minimum in $V(N)$ is associated with the solid-liquid interface. Note that single particle corresponds to a hypothetical solid whose surface is vey sparse. The difference between the plateau and minimum in each of these profiles may be expressed in terms of the interfacial free energies as follows: Here, A denotes the area of the plane that is parallel to the interface and $\gamma_{\mathrm{lv}}$, $\gamma_{\mathrm{sv}}$ and $\gamma_{\mathrm{sl}}$ denote liquid-vapor, solid-vapor and solid-liquid interfacial free energies. Since $\gamma_{\mathrm{lv}}$ is the property of fluid and can be independently determined, the above relation allows us to compute $\gamma_{\mathrm{sv}} - \gamma_{\mathrm{sl}}$."

<node TEXT="The curvature of the profiles in Figure \ref{VNLJ} provides important information about the effect of the solid on the density-density correlations at the solid-liquid interface. For $N$ where the curvature is positive, the second derivative $\frac{\mathrm{d^2}V}{\mathrm{d}N^{\mathrm{2}}}$ is related to the fluctuation in the number of fluid molecules $\langle \delta N^2 \rangle$ as follows: Here, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the temperature. Since TCs form important part of $\langle \delta N^2 \rangle$, the curvature of $V(N)$ provides important information about the effect of solid particles on the TCs. During the project we will attempt to derive the relationship between the above second order derivative and the local quantities associated with TCs like $\chi(\boldsymbol{r})$ and $\bar{h}(\lambda)$ that were described before. In Figure \ref{VNLJ} we also show $\frac{\mathrm{d^2}V}{\mathrm{d}N^{\mathrm{2}}}$ for the systems described in the previous paragraph.

<node TEXT="We will focus on the temperature dependence of the difference $\gamma_{\mathrm{sv}} - \gamma_{\mathrm{sl}}$ because this quantity is macroscopically defined for a solid-fluid system with a rigid solid. The derivative of this quantity with respect to temperature will be calculated using molecular simulations. The advantages of working with $\frac{\mathrm{d}(\gamma_{\mathrm{sv}}-\gamma_{\mathrm{sl}})}{\mathrm{d}T}$ instead of explicit dependence on temperature because of ease of relating the derivative to the molecular-scale phenomena. Also, the statistical mechanics of interfaces enables one to calculate $\frac{\mathrm{d}(\gamma_{\mathrm{sv}}-\gamma_{\mathrm{sl}})}{\mathrm{d}T}$ from the molecular simulation performed at a single temperature. Following the Gibb&apos;s formalism \cite{lyklema2005fundamentals}, one can write: Here, $S_{\mathrm{sf}}$ and $N_{\mathrm{sf}}$ are the solid-fluid excess entropy and excess number of molecules at  the solid-fluid interface, repectively ($\mathrm{f=v}$ for vapor and $\mathrm{f=l}$ for liquid). $A$ denotes the area of the plane of the interface that is used in the simulation. Any excess quantity $X_{\mathrm{sf}}$ is the difference between $X_{\mathrm{total}}$ calculated in presence of the solid and $X_{\mathrm{f}}$ calculated for the bulk fluid $f$. All the quantities on the right hand side of the above equation can be computed from the simulations performed at a single temperature. The temperature derivative of the saturation chemical potential is calculated using the energies and densities of the bulk liquid and vapor phases \cite{frenkel2001understanding}. The excess number of molecules are obtained from the probability distribution of the number of fluid molecules that is obtained from the GC simulations. The excess entropies are computed using the following relation: Here, $E_{\mathrm{sf}}$ denotes the excess energy that is collected during the simulation.

<node TEXT="Our reseach strategy in the approximate chronological order is explained below. First, we will develop computer algorithms and programs specifically for the grand canonical simulations of systems described earlier. This will also involve the utilization of suitable computer hardware. We will also perform the verification and validation of the developed software using suitable systems. The goal will be to perform few simulations for very long time and extract necessary data from them, instead of performing multiple simulations to obtain different quantities. This will be achieved by collecting the distributions of important instantaneous quantities instead of directly computing the ensemble averages or higher order moments during the simulation. Some advantages of this strategy are as follows: 1) The same system and simulation conditions are used for different calculations, and 2) the ease of handing the simulation uncertainties across multiple quantities. The latter point is particularly important for understanding the subtle correlations that may be overlooked due to statistical noise. Next, the actual systems of interest will be simulated. Most of these simulations will continue over the entire duration of the project because we expect to gain subtle insights about the system from the increasing precision of the data. Necessary quantities will be calculated and analysed at regular intervals. We will initially focus on the microscopic quantities like $\chi(\boldsymbol{r})$ and $\h(\boldsymbol{R})$. The main objective here will be to understand how the arrangement of solid particles and their chemical nature affect the range of TCs along the interface. We will then calculate $\frac{\mathrm{d}(\gamma_{\mathrm{sv}}-\gamma_{\mathrm{sl}})}{\mathrm{d}T}$ for the above systems and identify correlations with $\chi(\boldsymbol{r})$ . These correlations will be checked with the theoretical predictions.  Towards the end of the project, we will use the above results to identify the configurations of solid particles that have TCs of suitable range and $\frac{\mathrm{d}(\gamma_{\mathrm{sv}}-\gamma_{\mathrm{sl}})}{\mathrm{d}T}$ of suitable magnitudes so as to have potential technological applications."

<node TEXT="Coming to the transverse correlations (TCs), the author was involved in investigating their role in the solvation of small solutes near liquid-vapor interface \cite{rane2016understanding,rane2016using}. The computational methods and the theoretical framework used in those studies are also applicable in the proposed project. For example, in Figure \ref{solute_chi_d2VdN2} we show the local compressibility $\chi(z)$ and $\frac{\mathrm{d^2}V}{\mathrm{d}N^{\mathrm{2}}}$ for a liquid-vapor interface in presence and absence of a fixed solute. For a system with solute, we observe a smaller peak for $\chi(z)$ and $\frac{\mathrm{d^2}V}{\mathrm{d}N^{\mathrm{2}}}&gt;0$. This indicates the dampening of the TCs by the solute. Similar quantities will be also calculated in the proposed project. One may also recollect from our earlier discussion that a single solute molecule positioned near liquid-vapor interface can be interpreted as a hypothetical solid surface that is infinitely sparse. Thus, the contribution of TCs to the solvation free energy $\Delta\mu$ is analogous to their contribution to $\gamma_{\mathrm{sv}}-\gamma_{\mathrm{sl}}$. Preliminary derivations also suggest that the dampening of TCs by the solute affects $\frac{\mathrm{d}\Delta\mu}{\mathrm{d}T}$. This implies that the dampening of TCs by the solid surface atoms will affect \frac{\mathrm{d}(\gamma_{\mathrm{sv}}-\gamma_{\mathrm{sl}})}{\mathrm{d}T}$. In fact, preliminary observations (Figure \ref{crystal_chi_d2VdN2_dgdT}) do indicate a correlation between $\chi$ near different crystal surfaces, $\frac{\mathrm{d^2}V}{\mathrm{d}N^{\mathrm{2}}}$, and the trends in $\frac{\mathrm{d}(\gamma_{\mathrm{sv}}-\gamma_{\mathrm{sl}})}{\mathrm{d}T}$ vs $\gamma_{\mathrm{sv}}-\gamma_{\mathrm{sl}}$."
