Project for designing solid surfaces with desired temperature-dependence of wetting behavior.
The description is in the form of a proposal.
The project is the first step, where we investigate the importance of long-ranged transverse correlations across the solid-liquid interface.
The project used theoretical analysis using stat-mech, molecular simulations, possibly integral equation theories and few experiments.
The description may not include all the details of the project.
